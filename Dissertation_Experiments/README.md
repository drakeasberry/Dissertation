# Dissertation Code / Information - No Research Data

This directory contains all the python coding and PsychoPy experiments built for my Dissertation at the University of Arizona in 2019. However, no participant data is stored in this directory.

The segmentation experiment includes the following tasks:
	1. LexTALE-ESP - Spanish vocabulary task
	2. Segmentation Task - Visually segment words after being presented with a target sequence. Both practice and experimental blocks contain four conditions:
		A. CV-CV matching
		B. CV-CVC mismatching
		C. CVC-CVC matching
		D. CVC-CV mismatching
	3. Syllabification Task - 2 option forced-choice where participants decide what the first syllable of the word presented is. Includes practice and experimental blocks.
	4. LexTALE-ENG - English vocabulary task
	5. Basic Language Profile (BLP) - questionnaire collecting information about participant language uses, proficiency, history and attitudes.
