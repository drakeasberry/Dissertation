\section{Introduction}

This three article dissertation was written in order to complete the degree requirements of the Second Language Acquisition and Teaching program (SLAT) at the University of Arizona. The participant population for this dissertation are three distinct groups early and late Spanish–English bilingual speakers. The early bilingual group consists of speakers who began learning before the age of %INSERT AGE%. 
One of the late bilingual groups consists of native English speakers who were L2 learners of Spanish while the other consists of native Spanish speakers who were L2 learners of English. The dissertation investigates the ability of these three speaker populations and their ability to use the linguistic unit, a syllable, in their language processing strategies for Spanish. The three articles that compose this dissertation---chapters 2, 3 and 4---each correspond to one independent article and utiliize the same three bilingual speaker populations discussed above.

%-----------------------------------
%	SECTION 2
%-----------------------------------
\section{Background}
%\emph{this may be too direct of a start for the introduction, maybe something a little lighter or broad scheme (funnel approach).}
A syllable is a pronounceable linguistic unit of a given language that generally contains a highly sonorant sound as it nucleus—typically a vowel in most languages. Early research sought to discover the \emph{minimal perceptual unit} and the syllable was a logical and testable linguistic unit. In spoken language processing, the syllable made its highlight when it was found that participants could detect syllables faster than they could detect individual phonemes of which the syllable was comprised \citep*{Savin1970-oy}. This finding spurred interest in researchers focus on the syllable as well as other linguistic units such as word, phrases and sentences. The findings of these additional studies revealed that the processes involved in parsing spoken language were complex and a minimal perceptual unit was unlikely to be found. %\textbf{Should probably give more details about these studies here}.%
Specifically, one linguistic unit—phoneme, syllable, word, etc.—could not be the sole mechanism in which listeners of language break the speech stream into smaller or processable chunks \citep{Foss1973-ll,Healy1976-js,McNeill1973-bo}. 

Mehler and Hayes \parencite*{Mehler1981-wp} captured the need for a change in the direction of research regarding the syllable, “Traditionally, psycholinguistics research has invested the bulk of its efforts into uncovering the units used in speech processing. Although it is currently fashionable to claim that such work is pointless since it has no very clear outcome, many of the more meaningful advances in the field have come from projects whose framework included the problem of processing units.” They went on to delineate two different levels in which the research around the syllable could move forward: (1) The syllable as a phonological unit of the language which can efficiently explain the grammar of language and (2) The syllable as a unit which aides speech perception and language comprehension. As a result in the early 1980s, several researchers began refocusing their own investigations in accordance to this second vein of syllable research. %\textbf{Should cite and describe additional studies here}.% 
Even as researchers conducted more pointed research on the syllable's role in language processing strategies, the results continued to suggest research questions needed further subdivision. Ultimately, two distinct subprocesses of language processing in which the syllable may play a role---segmentation and lexical access---were proposed. 
% discuss the differences between segmentation and lexical access here.


%-----------------------------------
%	SECTION 3
%-----------------------------------

\section{Present Study}

This dissertation utilizes several different methodologies as a means to investigate research questions that fall under Mehler and Hayes \parencite*{Mehler1981-wp} second level of research. There are three overarching questions that underlie this dissertation project as a whole:
\begin{enumerate}
%revisit these research questions later
\item Whether or not the common linguistic unit—the syllable—is available to Spanish–English bilinguals when processing the Spanish language?
\item Whether or not the syllable is a strategy used by Spanish–English bilinguals in language segmentation and/or lexical access?
\item Does the age of acquisition, early versus late bilinguals, affect the ability and efficiency in which Spanish–English bilinguals can make use of the syllable?
\end{enumerate}

The three articles in this dissertation provide additional information about syllable structure and the representation of the syllable in Spanish to the knowledge base of the field. Within the segmentation strain of research, investigating differing types of bilingualism of the speaker who have the same two languages at their disposal provides new information to the fields of bilingualism and second language acquisition. At the time of writing this dissertation, the majority of research studies have been conducted with monolingual speakers. When studies have investigated the role of the syllable in language processing by bilinguals, they have generally compared the bilinguals against monolingual speakers of the two respective languages. However, previous studies suggest that bilinguals are not simply the summation of two independent monolingual speakers. For example, %Cutler citation% 
found that French--English bilinguals listening to French responded in the same manner as French monolinguals, but when listening to English, these speakers did not respond similarly to English monolinguals. Therefore, this dissertation does not utilize monolingual Spanish or monolingual English speaker controls, but instead utilizes three distinct bilingual populations of Spanish and English which are compared against each other. %\textbf{This type of setup allows for the control group to be the Spanish native L2 English speaker group and two test groups be early and late learners of Spanish.}% 
Many previous studies on lexical access have generally been conducted using the visual word recognition paradigm to study speech processing in conjunction with the syllable. Since the visual word recognition tasks have been conducted with both monolingual and bilingual populations, this dissertation seeks to add to the knowledge base of the syllable’s role through the replication of previous findings while testing a different population of bilingual speakers under the visual word recognition paradigm.

The format for the remaining chapters of this dissertation project will be as follows in order to address the main overarching questions: chapter 2 explores the representation of the syllable in the minds of Spanish–English bilinguals with a two option forced-choice syllabic intuition task. Chapter 3 utilizes a visual word segmentation task to compare the efficiency of the processes employed by the bilingual speakers. Chapter 4 includes a visual priming experiment with a lexical decision task that explores the syllable’s role in lexical access by Spanish–English bilinguals. Chapter 5 then concludes the dissertation project by drawing overall conclusions and how all three individual studies were necessary to draw the conclusions that were borne out through the various testing methodologies used to explore the role of the syllable in Spanish language processing in the three articles of the dissertation.

\section{Introduction}

%Talk about syllabificationdifferences in syllabification between spanish and english

The syllable intuition experiment is an important step in the process because how the three groups of participants syllabify the words will have a direct effect on how fast or useful the syllable is in their segmentation strategy. It is expected that syllabic intuitions will vary based on being a native speaker of Spanish, an early learner of Spanish or a late learner of Spanish. These differences are likely to stem from age of acquisition, language dominance or type of schooling. This experiment will begin to build a data source of Spanish–English bilinguals syllabification of Spanish words that will help to determine whether or not age of acquisition or language dominance are sources are different syllabification patterns.

\subsection{Participants}

The participants were split into three distinct populations of Spanish–English bilinguals. The Spanish–dominant group consisted of native speakers of Spanish that lived in Sonora, Mexico and learned English after %INSERT AGE%. 
The English–dominant group were native English speakers that lived in Tucson, Arizona and learned Spanish after%INSERT AGE%. 
The early bilingual group consisted of participants who lived in Tucson, Arizona, but were exposed to both English and Spanish before the %INSERT AGE%.
\emph{The participants will be placed into their appropriate group based off of the combined results of Bilingual Language Profile (BLP), the LexTALE and the LexTALE-Esp vocabulary tests.} 

Based off of responses in the BLP, participants who report proficiency in a language other than English and Spanish will be removed from the data analysis. According to the findings of Lemhöfer \& Broersma \parencite*{Lemhofer2012-hz}, the LexTALE vocabulary tests can distinguish between lower intermediate (up to 59 percent), upper intermediate (60–80 percent) and advanced (above 80 percent) levels of proficiency based on average percent correct responses. Participants that score lower than %INSERT CUTOFF PERCENTAGE HERE% 
were excluded due to having too low of a proficiency score in one of the two languages. The Spanish–dominant group had a %INSERT CUTOFF PERCENTAGE HERE% 
success rate in Spanish and it was higher than their English success rate. The English-dominant group scored %INSERT CUTOFF PERCENTAGE HERE%

\subsection{Instrumentation}
The LexTALE and the LexTALE-Esp are tasks used to correlate vocabulary knowledge and language proficiency in English and Spanish respectively \citep{Izura2014-yw,Lemhofer2012-hz}. The LexTALE-Esp has also been shown to discriminate well between highly proficient Spanish speaking participants with different language dominances \citep{Ferre2017-jq}. The LexTALE and LexTALE-Esp tests will be used in order to group participants into the appropriate bilingual population—Spanish–dominant bilinguals of L2 English, English–dominant bilinguals of L2 Spanish or early bilinguals who were exposed to both English and Spanish before %INSERT AGE%. 
LexTALE is publicly available online and has been designed to run in PRAAT, Matlab and Presentations. For data collection purposes in the current study, participants completed both the LexTALE and LexTALE-Esp using PsychoPy. 

A second instrument used in this study was the Bilingual Language Profile (BLP), which is a survey based assessment tool for determining language dominance \citep{Birdsong2012-wd}. It assesses language history, use, proficiency and attitudes of participants in less than 10 minutes. This assessment tool has been used in numerous language studies with a focus on bilingualism and is available for free under the creative commons license. This tool allowed for the collection of information about participants demographics---name, age, sex, place of residence and educational background---which took place at experiment setup in the current study. It also allowed for participants to indicate their language history, use, proficiency and attitudes and was the last task complete during the current study. Since the BLP survey was completed after all experimental trials, the participants were able to choose whether they received Spanish or English instructions for the survey. The BLP is publicly available in a paper-based format or electronic format through the use of Google Forms. In an effort to make the experiment seamless as possible, the participants in the current study took the BLP within the PsychoPy platform as well.

\subsection{Design}
The syllabic intuitions were elicited from participants through a forced two-choice task and were given as much time as needed to respond. Participants were shown a real word in Spanish on the screen and then were presented with two options below that represented a CV or CVC structure. There were 24 critical word pairs that were used as the stimuli in a previous experiment. Each word pair shared the first three letters, but differed in initial syllable structure. Using the example word pair \emph{balada–baldosa} to illustrate, it can easily been seen that both words begin with the letters \emph{bal}. However, the initial syllable structure of \emph{balada} is \emph{ba}, a CV structure, while the initial syllable structure of \emph{baldosa} is \emph{bal}, a CVC structure, when following standard Spanish syllabification. All other word pairs followed the same pattern where one word had a CV word-initial syllable structure and the other word began with a CVC syllable---where C represents a consonant and V represents a vowel. The order of presentation for the two syllabic options, CV or CVC, remained the same for the entire experiment for the participant, but was counterbalanced across participants. In order to counterbalance for hand dominance and visual presentation in this task, half of the participants used the left response button to indicate a CVC response and the right response button to indicate a CV response while the other half of the participants did the opposite. Since the position of response buttons aligned with screen position, half of the participants visually saw the orthographic representation of the CVC syllable to the left of screen center and the CV syllable orthographic representation on the right while the other half of the participants saw the opposite visual displays for syllable orthographic representations.

\subsection{Procedure}
Participants were seated in front of a laptop computer with a USB button box in order to complete the experiment in PsychoPy. At the beginning of the experiment, participants entered in demographic information as asked in the Basic Language Profile (BLP). Once they had entered the demographic information, all participants recruited from for this study completed the current experiment as an additional task of two additional ongoing experiments. Some participants completed this syllable intuition experiment following a visual word segmentation experiment while others completed it following a lexical decision experiment. Depending on the prior experiment completed, the overall procedural order of the time in the lab changed.

When the syllable intuition experiment was followed by the visual segmentation experiment, %INSERT NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS%
participants began the experimental session with the Spanish vocabulary task---LexTALE-Esp. Immediately upon the completion of the LexTALE-Esp, participants were given instructions for the practice portion of the visual segmentation experiment. Following the practice portion, participants were given an instruction screen that indicated they had completed the practice portion, reminded about the controls needed for the experiment, allowed to ask any remaining question about the process. When the participant was ready to begin the actual experiment, they pressed the white button on the response box to begin. Once the participants had finished the entire visual segmentation experiment, they were presented with instructions for the practice trials of the syllable intuition experiment. Once they completed the practice trials, they were given a second instruction screen indicating they had completed the practice portion and were about to begin the real experiment. Once participants had completed the syllabic intuition experiment, they completed the LexTALE-Eng followed by the BLP. 

When the syllable intuition experiment was followed lexical decision based priming experiment, the order differed slightly. In this scenario, participants were immediately presented with instructions for practice trials for the lexical decision priming experiment. Once they had completed the practice trials, a new instruction screen appeared stating that they were getting ready to start the actual experimental trials. Then participants received instructions for the syllable intuition experiment of which was immediately followed the three remaining tasks---LexTALE-Esp, LexTALE-Eng and the BLP.

The participants were instructed that they would see Spanish words presented individually on the computer screen and that each word would be followed by two options for the first syllable of the presented word. There was no time constraint for the participant to select the option that they considered to be the first syllable of the presented word and the experiment would not progress until the participant had indicated a response. %In the second experiment (Lexical Access), this was initially ran with 4 second time limit. It affected participants 062, 065-067, 069-072, 074-076 so these 11 participants should be checked for missing values.% 
In total, there were 10 practice trials that followed the same criteria and procedure as the 48 experimental trials presented to the participants. %same 11 participants had timing issue in practice trials, check if possible but values may not have been stored.% 
For each trial, the word in lowercase letters appeared in the center of the screen for 1500 milliseconds before being replaced by the two syllable options---one a CV syllable and the other a CVC syllable---which remained on the screen, in all capital letters, until a response was entered. Following each response, the screen remained blank for 500 milliseconds before the next word appeared. %It may be good to create a visual representation of the experiment here to illustrate what each participant saw.%
For half of the participants, the CV syllable option was on the left side of the screen while the CVC syllable option was on the right. For the other half of the participants, the CVC syllable option was on the left side of the screen while the CV syllable option was on the right. Participants were given separate instruction screens for practice and experimental trials that differed only in letting the participant know whether they are about to enter a practice or experimental phase. %\emph{Is this too repetitive? Should this be described here or in the Design section, currently it is in both} In this task it is worth noting that timing was not being measured but following the training session, most participants were trying to indicate their answer before the 1.5 second display time of the word since the syllables were always on the same side of the screen.

%\textbf{DELETE ME describe the analyses the researcher has done, but do not overload. Instead of creating a laundry list of statistics, create the story you want to tell using only the statistics that are related to addressing your problem. For each task, review the hypothesis, give the statistics and say what the result of the test means. Do not discuss the findings until you reach the discussion session. This is where tables and figures can help keep the paper looking clean and crisp instead of cluttered unorganized statistical test lists that are hard to follow. Figures show patterns while tables give details.}

\section{Discussion}

%\textbf{split into several small sections following each individual experiment’s results sections where applicable. The General Discussion steps back and begins with an overview of the problem and then the findings. A general rule of thumb is to keep this section shorter than the introduction. Only give limitation directly related to the current study, not the general limitation of the research or the field as a whole and be sure to give a good reason for why these limitations are not as bad as they sound on the surface.}
