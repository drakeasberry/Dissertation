               linguistics may be due primarily to inherent issues with the
               application of experimental methods to analyze an inextricably
               social phenomenon like language, as opposed to poor research
               practices. Because language use varies across social contexts,
               and because social context must vary across independent
               experimental replications, linguists should not be surprised
               when experimental results fail to replicate at the expected
               rate. To address issues with replication failure in linguistics,
               and to increase methodological rigor in our field more
               generally, I argue that linguists must use experimental methods
               carefully, keeping in mind their inherent limitations, while
               acknowledging the scientific value of observational methods,
               which are often the only way to pursue basic questions in our
               field.",

               shows that devices differ not only in average latency, but also
               in the distribution of their latencies, and that forced polling
               at 1000 Hz decreases latency for some but not all devices.
               Existing practices - measuring end-to-end latency as a proxy of
               input latency and reporting only mean values and standard
               deviations - hide these characteristic latency distributions
               caused by device intrinsics and polling rates. A probabilistic
               model of input device latency demonstrates these issues and
               matches our measurements. Thus, our work offers guidance for

  abstract = "Many researchers in the behavioral sciences depend on research
              software that presents stimuli, and records response times, with
              sub-millisecond precision. There are a large number of software
              packages with which to conduct these behavioral experiments and
              measure response times and performance of participants. Very
              little information is available, however, on what timing
              performance they achieve in practice. Here we report a
              wide-ranging study looking at the precision and accuracy of
              visual and auditory stimulus timing and response times, measured
              with a Black Box Toolkit. We compared a range of popular
              packages: PsychoPy, E-Prime\textregistered{}, NBS
              Presentation\textregistered{}, Psychophysics Toolbox, OpenSesame,
              Expyriment, Gorilla, jsPsych, Lab.js and Testable. Where
              possible, the packages were tested on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu,
              and in a range of browsers for the online studies, to try to
              identify common patterns in performance. Among the lab-based
              experiments, Psychtoolbox, PsychoPy, Presentation and E-Prime
              provided the best timing, all with mean precision under 1
              millisecond across the visual, audio and response measures.
              OpenSesame had slightly less precision across the board, but most
              notably in audio stimuli and Expyriment had rather poor
              precision. Across operating systems, the pattern was that
              precision was generally very slightly better under Ubuntu than
              Windows, and that macOS was the worst, at least for visual
              stimuli, for all packages. Online studies did not deliver the
              same level of precision as lab-based systems, with slightly more
              variability in all measurements. That said, PsychoPy and Gorilla,
              broadly the best performers, were achieving very close to
              millisecond precision on several browser/operating system
              combinations. For response times (measured using a
              high-performance button box), most of the packages achieved
              precision at least under 10 ms in all browsers, with PsychoPy
              achieving a precision under 3.5 ms in all. There was considerable
              variability between OS/browser combinations, especially in
              audio-visual synchrony which is the least precise aspect of the
              browser-based experiments. Nonetheless, the data indicate that
              online methods can be suitable for a wide range of studies, with
              due thought about the sources of variability that result. The
              results, from over 110,000 trials, highlight the wide range of
              timing qualities that can occur even in these dedicated software
              packages for the task. We stress the importance of scientists
              making their own timing validation measurements for their own
              stimuli and computer configuration.",

              should enhance reliance on grapheme-to-phoneme correspondences.
              In the present study, we examined whether Italian readers are
              sensitive to large orthographic units defined by the
              consonant-vowel (CV) pattern of words and that do not directly

              spoken syllables but comprising either one orthographic vowel
              cluster less than the number of syllables (hiatus words, e.g.,
              teatro) or as many vowel clusters as syllables (e.g., agosto).
              Relative to control words, readers were slower and less accurate
              for hiatus words, for which they underestimated the number of
              syllables. This underestimation bias demonstrates that Italian
              readers are sensitive to large orthographic units stemming from a
              parsing process based on the CV pattern-that is, the arrangement
              of consonant and vowel letters.",

  abstract = "Syllabification of spoken words has been largely used to define
              syllabic properties of written words, such as the number of
              syllables or syllabic boundaries. By contrast, some authors
              proposed that the functional structure of written words stems
              from visuo-orthographic features rather than from the
              transposition of phonological structure into the written
              modality. Thus, the first aim of the study was to assess whether
              the explicit segmentation of written words in French was
              consistent with syllabification patterns for spoken words
              previously reported. Second, given that spelling does not map
              perfectly with phonology, we examined how readers segmented
              printed words with grapheme/phoneme misalignments. The
              examination of the whole patterns of written segmentation
              produced by participants showed that, though written segmentation
              followed spoken segmentation for words matched for
              phonological/orthographic forms, discrepancies were found in
              cases of mismatch, therefore suggesting that readers rely on

  abstract = "This dissertation deals with the development of place of
              articulation and of rhythm in adult second language learners.
              English and Spanish, while sharing similar phonological stop
              inventories, have coronal stops that differ as a matter of
              gestural target: In English, the coronal stops have an alveolar
              place of articulation, whereas they have a dental target in
              Spanish. Previous research on the acquisition of second language
              stops, particularly as a function of the acoustic correlates of
              voicing, have found that second language learners find acquiring
              stop contrasts particularly challenging; however, to date, no
              published data exist on the acquisition of L2 stops that have
              unique gestural targets. English and Spanish also differ
              typologically as a matter of their rhythm, with English being
              categorized as stress-timed and Spanish as syllable-timed.
              Previous research has shown that adults are capable of acquiring
              aspects of their L2 rhythm; however, the findings have been
              mixed. Furthermore, detailed developmental data on L2 rhythm is
              lacking. The present dissertation addresses both the acquisition
              of place of articulation and of rhythm in a cross-sectional
              design. The production data of 41 female, adult native speakers
              of English learning Spanish were collected and compared to those
              of 9 female adult native bilinguals of English and Spanish. The
              learners were assigned to four different study conditions based
              on their linguistic experience. The results suggest that the
              native bilinguals produce Spanish and English with
              language-specific gestural targets for their coronal stops and
              language-specific rhythm patterns in the direction expected for
              each language. The data from the language learners imply that, on
              the one hand, adults learning a second language are capable of
              developing increasingly target-like gestural targets in their L2
              Spanish coronal stop production as they gain experience with the
              second language. On the other hand, the rhythm data reveal that
              speakers of a second language quickly learn to make adjustments
              to their rhythm toward target-like norms, but that evidence of
              transfer remains. The implications of the findings are discussed
              with respect to second language phonological theory.",

              orthographic and semantic-associative training is a more
              advantageous strategy for the lexicalization of novel written
              word-forms than their single orthographic training. However,
              paradigms used previously involve explicit stimuli categorization
              (lexical decision), which likely influence word learning. In the
              present study, we used a more automatic task (silent reading) to
              determine the advantage of the associative training, by comparing
              the brain electrical signals elicited in combined (orthographic
              and semantic) and single (only orthographic) training conditions.
              In addition, the learning effect (in terms of similar
              neurophysiological activity between novel and known words) was
              also tested under a categorization paradigm, enabling
              determination of the possible influence of the training task in
              the lexicalization process. Results indicated that novel words
              repeatedly associated with meaningful cues showed a higher
              attenuation of N400 responses than those trained in the single
              orthographic condition, confirming the higher facilitation in the
              lexico-semantic processing of these stimuli, as a consequence of
              semantic associations. Moreover, only when the combined training
              was carried out in the reading task did novel words show similar
              N400 responses to those elicited by known words, suggesting the
              achievement of a similar lexical processing to known words.
              Crucially, when the training is carried out under a demanding
              task context (lexical decision), known words exhibited positive
              enhancement within the N400 time window, contributing to
              maintaining N400 differences with novel trained words and
              confounding the outcome of the learning. Such
              deflection-compatible with the modulation of the
              categorization-related P300 component-suggests that novel word
              learning could be influenced by the activation of
              categorization-related processes. Thus, the use of low-demand
              tasks arises as a more appropriate approach to study novel word
              learning, enabling the build-up process of mental
              representations, which probably depends on pure lexical and
              semantic factors rather than being guided by categorization
              demands.",

               the mismatch between empirical evidence and this widespread

               a relationship between perceived tempo and acoustic vowel space

               speakers but with varying vowel space sizes were conducted.
               Listeners were asked to rate the perceived speech tempo of

              acoustic and physiological correlates of this quality. One male
              and one female subject read a text habitually and with a throaty
              voice quality. Oral pressure during p-occlusion was measured as
              an estimate of subglottal pressure. Long-term average spectrum
              analysis described the average spectrum characteristics. Sixteen
              syllables, perceptually evaluated with regard to throaty quality
              by five experts, were selected for analysis. Formant frequencies
              and voice source characteristics were measured by means of
              inverse filtering, and the vocal tract shape of the throaty and
              normal versions of the vowels [a,u,i,ae] of the male subject were
              recorded by magnetic resonance imaging. From this material, area
              functions were derived and their resonance frequencies were

              a pharynx that was narrower than in the habitually produced
              versions. To test the relevance of formant frequencies to
              perceived throaty quality, experts rated degree of throatiness in
              synthetic vowel samples, in which the measured formant frequency
              values of the subject were used. The main acoustic correlates of
              throatiness seemed to be an increase of F1, a decrease of F4, and

              narrowing of the pharynx. In the male subject, voice source

               a function of speakers' heights and weights. In Experiment II
               correlations were calculated from formant parameters obtained by
               means of a long-term average analysis of connected speech from
               91 speakers. Results of both experiments showed that, in
               contrast to Fitch's (J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 102 (1997) 1213)
               findings in macaque vocalizations, the relationship within sex
               between formant parameters and body size is very weak in human
               adults. At the same time, it is evident that correlations within
               the female group are greater than in male group. These results
               imply that the pattern of individual vocal tract development is
               relatively free from skeletal size constraints, due to the human
               descent of larynx from standard mammal position. This
               disassociation of vocal tract-body size is more important in

              of text reading at two intensity levels was acoustically
              analyzed. The central concept was the speaker's formant (SPF),
              related to the perceptual characteristics ``better normal voice
              quality'' (BNQ) and ``worse normal voice quality'' (WNQ). The
              purpose of the current study was to get closer to the origin of
              the phenomenon of the SPF, and to discover the differences in
              spectral and formant characteristics between the two professional
              groups and the two voice quality groups. The acoustic analyses
              were long-term average spectrum (LTAS) and spectrographical
              measurements of formant frequencies. At very high intensities,
              the spectral slope was rather quandrangular without a clear SPF
              peak. The trained voices had a higher energy level in the SPF
              region compared with the untrained, significantly so in loud
              phonation. The SPF seemed to be related to both sufficiently
              strong overtones and a glottal setting, allowing for a lowering
              of F4 and a closeness of F3 and F4. However, the existence of SPF
              also in LTAS of the WNQ voices implies that more research is
              warranted concerning the formation of SPF, and concerning the

               Female preferences for males with low fundamental frequencies
               and large vocal tract lengths are potentially adaptive. Although
               sexually dimorphic characteristics of male voices have been
               studied, the impact of manipulations of secondary sexual
               characteristics on preferences for male voices has not. We
               manipulated fundamental frequencies and apparent vocal tract
               lengths of young adult male voices, both independently and
               simultaneously, and assessed their impact on female ratings of
               masculinity, size, age and attractiveness. Lowering the
               fundamental frequencies and/or increasing apparent vocal tract
               lengths of male voices increased females' ratings of the
               masculinity, size and age of the speaker. Peer group females
               preferred male voices with (1) lowered fundamental frequencies
               to those with raised fundamental frequencies, and (2) original
               frequencies to male voices with raised fundamental frequencies

               manipulation to reflect acoustic characteristics of 16-year-old
               male voices). This suggests that male voices with acoustic
               characteristics that reflect full sexual maturity may be
               attractive. Although no general preference was observed for male
               voices with increased or decreased apparent vocal tract lengths,
               female preferences for male voices with increased apparent vocal
               tract lengths were positively related to females' own body size.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The frequency components of the human voice play a
              major role in signalling the gender of the speaker. A voice
              imitation study was conducted to investigate individuals' ability
              to make behavioural adjustments to fundamental frequency (F0),
              and formants (Fi) in order to manipulate their expression of
              voice gender. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thirty-two native
              British-English adult speakers were asked to read out loud
              different types of text (words, sentence, passage) using their
              normal voice and then while sounding as 'masculine' and
              'feminine' as possible. Overall, the results show that both men
              and women raised their F0 and Fi when feminising their voice, and
              lowered their F0 and Fi when masculinising their voice.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These observations suggest that adult
              speakers are capable of spontaneous glottal and vocal tract
              length adjustments to express masculinity and femininity in their
              voice. These results point to a ``gender code'', where speakers

               sociolinguistic processes through which phonetic resources are
               mobilized in the construction of a gendered voice. This article
               argues that gender differences in the voice---including those
               influenced by physiology---are best understood as elements of
               sociolinguistic style rather than static properties. With a
               focus on transgender speakers in the early stages of
               masculinizing hormone therapy, the analysis demonstrates the
               complex interrelationship of the gendered meanings attributable
               to characteristics like fundamental frequency and /s/. Trans
               speakers challenge systems for categorizing voices as female or
               male, which assume that different aspects of the gendered voice
               will pattern together in normative ways. Yet a voice's gender is
               not a unidimensional feature, but a cluster of features that
               take on meaning only in context with one another, leaving them
               open for recombination and change through stylistic bricolage.

               focused on the perception of men's sexuality on the basis of
               disembodied voices. However, inconsistencies across these
               studies limit our ability to unite their findings into a
               cohesive model of gay-sounding speech. This paper focuses on
               variability among gay-sounding speakers by analyzing the voices

               gay-sounding, their sociolinguistic styles also differ from

              reliable linguistic expectations. However, the link between the
              variability of the linguistic background of the speaker and the
              hierarchical format of the representations predicted is still not
              clear. We here investigate whether native language exposure to
              typologically highly diverse languages (Spanish and Basque)
              affects the way early balanced bilingual speakers carry out
              language predictions. During Spanish sentence comprehension,
              participants developed predictions of words the form of which
              (noun ending) could be either diagnostic of grammatical gender
              values (transparent) or totally ambiguous (opaque). We measured
              electrophysiological prediction effects time-locked both to the
              target word and to its determiner, with the former being expected
              or unexpected. Event-related (N200-N400) and oscillatory activity
              in the low beta-band (15-17Hz) frequency channel showed that both
              Spanish and Basque natives optimally carry out lexical
              predictions independently of word transparency. Crucially, in
              contrast to Spanish natives, Basque natives displayed visual word
              form predictions for transparent words, in consistency with the
              relevance that noun endings (post-nominal suffixes) play in their
              native language. We conclude that early language exposure largely
              shapes prediction mechanisms, so that bilinguals reading in their
              second language rely on the distributional regularities that are
              highly relevant in their first language. More importantly, we
              show that individual linguistic experience hierarchically

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTMore than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a
               reformation of academic statistics. In ?The Future of Data
               Analysis,? he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized
               science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or
               ?data analysis.? Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu,
               Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged
               academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the
               classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for
               more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than
               statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on
               prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even
               suggested the catchy name ?data science? for this envisioned
               field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of
               ?data science? programs at major universities, including UC
               Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of
               Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M ?Data
               Science Initiative? that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching
               in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular
               subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many
               academic statisticians perceive the new programs as ?cultural
               appropriation.? This article reviews some ingredients of the
               current ?data science moment,? including recent commentary about
               data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data
               science is really different from statistics. The
               now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of
               the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some
               technology for ?scaling up? to ?big data.? This chosen superset
               is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual
               developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the
               really important intellectual event of the next 50 years.
               Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be
               mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere
               ?scaling up,? but instead the emergence of scientific studies of
               data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to
               predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would
               impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even
               predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey,
               Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data
               science based on the activities of people who are ?learning from
               data,? and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving
               that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a
               better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning
               than today?s data science initiatives, while being able to
               accommodate the same short-term goals. Based on a presentation

               with other representations such as semantics and phonology

              recognition: Evidence from Spanish",
  author   = "Dom{\'\i}nguez Mart{\'\i}nez, Alberto and Cuetos Vega, Fernando",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many pairs of words in Spanish, in particular many
              verbal forms, differ only in the syllable stressed, such as aNImo
              (I encourage) and aniM{\'O} (he encouraged). Consequently, word
              stress may acquire a lexical contrastive value that has been
              confirmed by Dupoux, Pallier, Sebastian, and Mehler (1997) for
              Spanish speakers though not for French speakers in auditory
              perception. METHOD: This study contrasts the priming effect
              produced by pairs of written words that differ only in their
              stress pattern with the priming effect in repetition priming,
              stress only priming (with no orthographic relation), and
              morphological priming, in visual word recognition. RESULTS: The
              results, using short and masked prime presentation, showed
              facilitation for different stress (orthographically identical)
              pairs (rasG{\'O}/RASgo) compared to totally unrelated pairs
              (rasG{\'O}/RASgo) but no facilitation compared to
              orthographically unrelated (but stress related) pairs
              (PERsa/RASgo). However, identity pairs (RASgo-RASgo) produced
              facilitation compared to both orthographically unrelated
              conditions. At long SOA, orthographically related (stress
              unrelated) pairs produced significant facilitation, as occurred
              with morphologically related pairs (RASga/RASgo), on the
              orthographically unrelated words (PERsa/RASgo). CONCLUSION: These
              results confirm the early and prelexical importance of word
              stress for lexical selection in Spanish, as is the case with
              orthographic and phonological features.",

  abstract  = "Lexical priming is known to arise from phonological similarity
               between prime and target, and this phenomenon is an important
               component of our understanding of the processes of lexical
               access and competition. However, the precise nature of the role
               of phonological similarity in lexical priming is understudied.
               In the present study, two experiments were conducted in which
               participants performed auditory lexical decision on CVC targets
               which were preceded by primes that either matched the target in
               all phonemes (CVC condition), in the first two phonemes (CV\_
               condition), the last two phonemes (\_VC condition), the initial
               and last phonemes (C\_C condition) or no phonemes (unrelated
               condition). Relative to the unrelated condition, all conditions
               except CV\_ led to facilitation of response time to target
               words. The \_VC and C\_C conditions led to equivalent
               facilitation magnitude, while the CV\_ condition showed neither
               facilitation nor inhibition. Accounting for these results
               requires appeal to processes of lexical competition and also to
               the notion that phonemes do not lend equivalent phonological
               similarity; that is, vowels and consonants are processed

              English-speakers. Greater pre-training activation in right
              inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) to Mandarin speech was associated

              four weeks of class, learners showed overall increased activation
              in left IFG and left superior parietal lobule (SPL) to Mandarin
              speech, but in neither region was variation related to learning

              investigated the timing accuracy of the SMART in measuring
              reaction time (RT) under different conditions of operating
              systems (OSs; Windows XP or Vista) and monitor displays (a CRT or
              an LCD). The results indicated that the timing error in measuring
              RT by the SMART was less than 2 msec, on average, under all
              combinations of OS and display and that the SMART was tolerant to
              jitter and noise. In Experiment 2, we tested the SMART with 8

              difference among RTs obtained with the SMART under the different

              paradigms. Often keyboards are employed to collect buttonpresses,
              but their imprecision and variability decreases test power and
              increases the risk of false positives. Response boxes and data
              acquisition cards are precise, but expensive and inflexible,
              alternatives. We propose using open-source Arduino
              microcontroller boards as an inexpensive and flexible
              alternative. These boards connect to standard experimental
              software using a USB connection and a virtual serial port, or by
              emulating a keyboard. In our solution, an Arduino measures
              response latencies after being signaled the start of a trial, and
              communicates the latency and response back to the PC over a USB
              connection. We demonstrated the reliability, robustness, and
              precision of this communication in six studies. Test measures
              confirmed that the error added to the measurement had an SD of
              less than 1 ms. Alternatively, emulation of a keyboard results in
              similarly precise measurement. The Arduino performs as well as a
              serial response box, and better than a keyboard. In addition, our
              setup allows for the flexible integration of other sensors, and
              even actuators, to extend the cognitive science toolbox.",

              their native language, but, as in their native language, use
              mono- and bisyllabic information to an equal extent. In

              consistently classified according to place of articulation,

              consistently identified. The acoustic attributes of the stimuli
              were examined to determine whether invariant properties
              characterized each place of atriculation independent of vowel
              context. It was determined that the gross shape of the spectrum
              sampled at the consonantal release showed a distinctive shape for
              each place of articulation: a prominent midfrequency spectral
              peak for velars, a diffuse-rising spectrum for alveolars, and a
              diffuse-falling spectrum for labials. These attributes are
              evident for stimuli containing transitions only, but are enhanced
              by the presence of noise bursts at the onset.",

              language. Strong cross-linguistic tendencies in syllable size and
              shape are often explained in terms of a universal preference for
              the CV structure, a type which is also privileged in abstract

              This dissertation is an investigation of the properties of
              languages with highly complex syllable patterns. The two aims are
              (i) to establish whether these languages share other linguistic
              features in common such that they constitute a distinct
              linguistic type, and (ii) to identify possible diachronic paths
              and natural mechanisms by which these patterns come about in the
              history of a language. These issues are investigated in a
              diversified sample of 100 languages, 24 of which have highly
              complex syllable patterns. Languages with highly complex syllable
              structure are characterized by a number of phonological and
              morphological features which serve to set these languages apart
              from languages with simpler syllable patterns: these include
              specific segmental and suprasegmental properties, a higher
              prevalence of vowel reduction processes, higher rates of
              morphologically complex clusters, and higher average
              morpheme/word ratios. The results suggest that highly complex
              syllable structure is a linguistic type distinct from but sharing
              some characteristics of other proposed holistic language types,
              including stress-timing, agglutination, and consonantal
              languages. The results also point to word stress and specific
              patterns of gestural organization as playing important roles in
              the development of these patterns out of simpler syllable
              structures.",

                   researchers typically have specific hypotheses about which
                   condition means differ from each other, a priori contrasts
                   (i.e., comparisons planned before the sample means are
                   known) between specific conditions or combinations of
                   conditions are the appropriate way to represent such
                   hypotheses in the statistical model. Many researchers have
                   pointed out that contrasts should be ``tested instead of,
                   rather than as a supplement to, the ordinary 'omnibus' F
                   test'' (Hays, 1973, p. 601). In this tutorial, we explain
                   the mathematics underlying different kinds of contrasts
                   (i.e., treatment, sum, repeated, polynomial, custom, nested,
                   interaction contrasts), discuss their properties, and
                   demonstrate how they are applied in the R System for
                   Statistical Computing (R Core Team, 2018). In this context,
                   we explain the generalized inverse which is needed to
                   compute the coefficients for contrasts that test hypotheses
                   that are not covered by the default set of contrasts. A
                   detailed understanding of contrast coding is crucial for
                   successful and correct specification in linear models

              consistent with a similar asymmetry previously observed in Dutch

              long-term cross-modal repetition priming as a means to
              investigate the underlying lexical representations involved in

              identified auditory-only words during exposure and visual-only
              words at test. Words at test were repeated or new and produced by
              the exposure speaker or a novel speaker. Results showed a

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Researchers have begun to use eye tracking in the visual
              world paradigm (VWP) to study clinical differences in language
              processing, but the reliability of such laboratory tests has
              rarely been assessed. In this article, the authors assess
              test-retest reliability of the VWP for spoken word recognition.
              Methods Participants performed an auditory VWP task in repeated
              sessions and a visual-only VWP task in a third session. The
              authors performed correlation and regression analyses on several
              parameters to determine which reflect reliable behavior and which
              are predictive of behavior in later sessions. RESULTS: Results
              showed that the fixation parameters most closely related to
              timing and degree of fixations were moderately-to-strongly
              correlated across days, whereas the parameters related to rate of
              increase or decrease of fixations to particular items were less
              strongly correlated. Moreover, when including factors derived
              from the visual-only task, the performance of the regression
              model was at least moderately correlated with Day 2 performance
              on all parameters ( R > .30). CONCLUSION: The VWP is stable
              enough (with some caveats) to serve as an individual measure.
              These findings suggest guidelines for future use of the paradigm
              and for areas of improvement in both methodology and analysis.",

               working memory (WM) mediate their anticipatory abilities. Our
               findings show that the monolinguals used prosodic information to
               predict word endings in both tasks, regardless of first-syllable
               stress (stressed, unstressed) and structure (CV, CVC). In

               phonemes. Four experiments here examine whether this difficulty
               is in part due to phantom competition from ``near-words'' in
               speech. Dutch listeners confuse English /{\ae}/ and
               /$\epsilon$/, which could lead to the sequence daf being
               interpreted as deaf, or lemp being interpreted as lamp. In
               auditory lexical decision, Dutch listeners indeed accepted such
               near-words as real English words more often than English
               listeners did. In cross-modal priming, near-words extracted from
               word or phrase contexts (daf from DAFfodil, lemp from eviL
               EMPire) induced activation of corresponding real words (deaf;
               lamp) for Dutch, but again not for English, listeners. Finally,
               by the end of untruncated carrier words containing embedded
               words or near-words (definite; daffodil) no activation of the
               real embedded forms (deaf in definite) remained for English or
               Dutch listeners, but activation of embedded near-words (deaf in
               daffodil) did still remain, for Dutch listeners only.
               Misinterpretation of the initial vowel here favoured the phantom
               competitor and disfavoured the carrier (lexically represented as
               containing a different vowel). Thus, near-words compete for
               recognition and continue competing for longer than actually

              selection of the correct words achieved by a process of
              competition between them. L2 listening involves more such
              activation than L1 listening, and we report two studies
              illustrating this. First, in a lexical decision study, L2
              listeners accepted (but L1 listeners did not accept) spoken

              presented orthographically related primes on target word
              recognition in bilinguals. The prime stimuli were high-frequency
              words either from the same language as that of the target or from
              the other language known by the bilingual subjects. When the
              prime and target were from the same language, orthographically
              related primes systematically inhibited target word recognition,
              whereas orthographically dissimilar primes did not. When the

              of inhibition increased as a function of subjects' level of
              proficiency in the prime word's language, with highly proficient
              bilinguals showing practically equivalent amounts of within and

               phonetics (the study of sounds) and phonology (the study of
               sound systems) and describes in detail the phonetic and
               phonological characteristics of Spanish as it is spoken in both
               Spain and Latin America. Topics covered include consonants,
               vowels, acoustics, stress, syllables, intonation, and aspects of
               variation within Spanish. Clear comparisons are made between the
               sounds of Spanish and those of English, and students are
               encouraged to put theory into practice with over fifty graded
               exercises. Setting a solid foundation in the description and
               analysis of Spanish sounds, The Sounds of Spanish will help
               students improve their pronunciation of the language, and will
               also be useful to those studying the linguistic structure of

               from sources such as usage-based studies, psycholinguistic
               experiments, corpus data, and computer simulations. Arguments
               are presented to demonstrate that these kinds of evidence are
               crucial for establishing theories of language that relate to the
               psychological mechanisms involved in producing and comprehending
               speech, in contrast to theories about abstract linguistic

               diphthongization, gender, morphophonemic alternations, and
               epenthesis. An appendix is included that serves as a primer on
               quantitative linguistic research. It discusses how some of the

              examined. All are found to be observationally and/or
              descriptively incorrect. Among the descriptive proposals
              regarding Spanish diphthongization that are shown to be untenable
              are: (a) that a diacritic (i.e. phonetically uninterpreted) mark
              can be dispensed with, (b) that the simple vowels |e|, |o| are
              derived from the diphthongs |ye|, |we|, respectively, rather than
              the diphthongs from the vowels, and (c) that these alternations

              motivated rules. A new analysis is motivated which incorporates
              the contraries of these proposals and which remedies the

               meaning in its association with the status and stance of
               speakers in the context of interaction. This indexical function
               of variation can contribute to the advancement of ongoing
               linguistic change. Style shifting in individual sociolinguistic
               interviews is an indirect indication of social meaning, but the
               clearest demonstrations are found in studies of speakers in a
               range of social contexts. We explore and clarify the nature of
               social meaning in variation, and its relation to linguistic
               change. Phonological variables are most readily adapted to
               convey social meaning by their frequency, flexibility and
               freedom from referential functions. After providing several
               kinds of evidence of social meaning in phonological variation,

               which those sounds participate. Mergers, near mergers, splits,

              responses corresponded to the expected canonical CV.CV
              segmentation, but a small proportion included the intervocalic
              consonant in both the first and second syllables, a result
              previously interpreted for English as indicating ambisyllabicity.
              Two further partial-repetition experiments showed that listeners
              systematically include the consonant in the onset of the second
              syllable, but also often include it in the offset of the first
              syllable. In addition, the assignment of the intervocalic
              consonant to the first and second syllables was differentially
              sensitive to the sonority of the consonant and to its spelling.
              We argue that the findings are inconsistent with the
              traditionally held boundary conception and instead support the
              view that distinct processes are involved in locating the onsets
              and the offsets of syllables. Onset determination is both more
              reliable and more dominant. Finally, we propose that syllable
              onsets serve as alignment points for the lexical search process

  abstract  = "Speaking tasks involving peer-to-peer candidate interaction are
               increasingly being incorporated into language proficiency
               assessments, in both large-scale international testing contexts,
               and in smaller-scale, for example course-related, ones. This
               growth in the popularity and use of paired and group orals has
               stimulated research, particularly into the types of discourse
               produced and the possible impact of candidate background factors
               on performance. However, despite the fact that the strongest
               argument for the validity of peer-to-peer assessment lies in the
               claim that such tasks allow for the assessment of a broader
               range of interactional skills than the more traditional
               interview-format tests do, there is surprisingly little research
               into the judgments that are made of such performances. The fact
               that raters, and rating criteria, are in a crucial mediating
               position between output and outcomes, warrants investigation
               into how raters construe the interaction in these tasks. Such
               investigations have the potential to inform the development of
               interaction-based rating scales and ensure that validity claims
               are moved beyond the content level to the construct level. This
               paper reports the findings of a verbal protocol study of
               teacher-raters viewing the paired test discourse of 17 beginner
               dyads in a university-based Spanish as a foreign language
               course. The findings indicate that the raters identified three
               interaction parameters: non-verbal interpersonal communication,
               interactive listening, and interactional management. The
               findings have implications for our understanding of the
               construct of effective interaction in paired candidate speaking
               tests, and for the development of appropriate rating scales.

  abstract  = "What is a rubric? A rubric is a coherent set of criteria for
               student work that describes levels of performance quality.
               Sounds simple enough, right? Unfortunately, rubrics are commonly
               misunderstood and misused. The good news is that when rubrics
               are created and used correctly, they are strong tools that
               support and enhance classroom instruction and student learning.
               In this comprehensive guide, author Susan M. Brookhart
               identifies two essential components of effective rubrics: (1)
               criteria that relate to the learning (not the ``tasks'') that
               students are being asked to demonstrate and (2) clear
               descriptions of performance across a continuum of quality. She
               outlines the difference between various kinds of rubrics (for
               example, general versus task-specific, and analytic versus
               holistic), explains when using each type of rubric is
               appropriate, and highlights examples from all grade levels and
               assorted content areas. In addition, Brookhart addresses *
               Common misconceptions about rubrics; * Important differences
               between rubrics and other assessment tools such as checklists
               and rating scales, and when such alternatives can be useful; and
               * How to use rubrics for formative assessment and grading,
               including standards-based grading and report card grades.
               Intended for educators who are already familiar with rubrics as
               well as those who are not, this book is a complete resource for
               writing effective rubrics and for choosing wisely from among the
               many rubrics that are available on the Internet and from other
               sources. And it makes the case that rubrics, when used
               appropriately, can improve outcomes by helping teachers teach

              writing teachers, and yet many graduate programs do not require
              students to take a course in assessment or evaluation, and
              courses on teaching writing often devote only a limited amount of

  author    = "Kruschke, John K",
  abstract  = "There is an explosion of interest in Bayesian statistics,
               primarily because recently created computational methods have
               finally made Bayesian analysis obtainable to a wide
               audience.Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS,
               and Stan provides an accessible approach to Bayesian data
               analysis, as material is explained clearly with concrete
               examples. The book begins with the basics, including essential
               concepts of probability and random sampling, and gradually
               progresses to advanced hierarchical modeling methods for
               realistic data. Included are step-by-step instructions on how to
               conduct Bayesian data analyses in the popular and free software
               R and WinBugs. This book is intended for first-year graduate
               students or advanced undergraduates. It provides a bridge
               between undergraduate training and modern Bayesian methods for
               data analysis, which is becoming the accepted research standard.
               Knowledge of algebra and basic calculus is a prerequisite.New to
               this Edition (partial list):There are all new programs in JAGS
               and Stan. The new programs are designed to be much easier to use
               than the scripts in the first edition. In particular, there are
               now compact high-level scripts that make it easy to run the
               programs on your own data sets. This new programming was a major
               undertaking by itself.The introductory Chapter 2, regarding the
               basic ideas of how Bayesian inference re-allocates credibility
               across possibilities, is completely rewritten and greatly
               expanded.There are completely new chapters on the programming
               languages R (Ch. 3), JAGS (Ch. 8), and Stan (Ch. 14). The
               lengthy new chapter on R includes explanations of data files and
               structures such as lists and data frames, along with several
               utility functions. (It also has a new poem that I am
               particularly pleased with.) The new chapter on JAGS includes
               explanation of the RunJAGS package which executes JAGS on
               parallel computer cores. The new chapter on Stan provides a
               novel explanation of the concepts of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
               The chapter on Stan also explains conceptual differences in
               program flow between it and JAGS.Chapter 5 on Bayes' rule is
               greatly revised, with a new emphasis on how Bayes' rule
               re-allocates credibility across parameter values from prior to
               posterior. The material on model comparison has been removed
               from all the early chapters and integrated into a compact
               presentation in Chapter 10.What were two separate chapters on
               the Metropolis algorithm and Gibbs sampling have been
               consolidated into a single chapter on MCMC methods (as Chapter
               7). There is extensive new material on MCMC convergence
               diagnostics in Chapters 7 and 8. There are explanations of
               autocorrelation and effective sample size. There is also
               exploration of the stability of the estimates of the HDI limits.
               New computer programs display the diagnostics, as well.Chapter 9
               on hierarchical models includes extensive new and unique
               material on the crucial concept of shrinkage, along with new
               examples.All the material on model comparison, which was spread
               across various chapters in the first edition, in now
               consolidated into a single focused chapter (Ch. 10) that
               emphasizes its conceptualization as a case of hierarchical
               modeling.Chapter 11 on null hypothesis significance testing is
               extensively revised. It has new material for introducing the
               concept of sampling distribution. It has new illustrations of
               sampling distributions for various stopping rules, and for
               multiple tests.Chapter 12, regarding Bayesian approaches to null
               value assessment, has new material about the region of practical
               equivalence (ROPE), new examples of accepting the null value by
               Bayes factors, and new explanation of the Bayes factor in terms
               of the Savage-Dickey method.Chapter 13, regarding statistical
               power and sample size, has an extensive new section on
               sequential testing, and making the research goal be precision of

               maintains syllable-final (s) as full sibilants, aspiration
               enters the dialect as a prestige marker owing to its
               identification with the linguistic model of the speech of
               Montevideo. Data analysis reveals social and linguistic factors
               that condition the variable, and explores the role of aspiration
               as an ultra-local marker that has been incorporated by social
               groups who, by converging their speech with that of Montevideo,
               cause it to diverge from the local norm.",

              adaptation occurs in bilinguals who must resolve two competing
              requirements: an accurate mental representation of the word from
              the source language and the phonological requirements of the
              receiving language. The prediction is that this duel requirement
              would result in the phonetic quality of loanwords being
              categorically different for bilinguals from the phonetic quality
              of native words in the receiving language. French loanwords into
              Moroccan Arabic (MA) are often borrowed with pharyngeal secondary
              articulation (``emphasis''), a feature which affects the quality
              of adjacent vowels. To test these predictions, French-MA
              bilingual production of native and borrowed MA words and

               leftward, and labialization spreads rightward, targeting short

               whether the feature is anchored to the onset or the release

  abstract = "Acoustic and perceptual effects of emphasis, a secondary
              articulation in the posterior vocal tract, were investigated in
              Urban Jordanian Arabic. Twelve speakers of Jordanian Arabic
              recorded both consonants and vowels of monosyllabic minimal CVC
              pairs containing plain or emphatic consonants in initial and
              final position to investigate the extent of coarticulatory
              effects of emphasis. In general, the acoustic correlates of
              emphasis include a raised F1, lowered F2, and raised F3 in the
              vowel adjacent to the emphatic consonant, consistent with a
              narrowing near the uvula. These effects are similar in magnitude
              for vowels following and preceding emphatic consonants. In
              addition, the spectral mean of emphatic stops, but not emphatic
              fricatives, was lower than that of plain consonants. A perception
              study with cross-spliced natural stimuli explored whether Arabic
              listeners' recognition of emphasis is based on information in the
              target consonant or the rest of the word (vowel+non-target
              consonant). Results show that the rest of the word contributes
              significantly more to the perception of emphasis than the target
              consonant itself. Overall, the acoustic data and perceptual
              results will address the correlates of emphasis, spread of
              emphasis, and the asymmetry between stops and fricatives.",

  abstract = "This exploratory study of Jordanian and Moroccan Arabic (JA and

              an epilaryngeal constriction which causes `retraction' and tense
              voice quality in surrounding vowels, following the Laryngeal
              Articulator Model (LAM) (Esling, 2005). Twenty male speakers (10
              per dialect) produced vowels preceded by /d or dˤ/. Thirteen
              acoustic correlates obtained at the onset and midpoint were used
              to assess this type of constriction. A predictive modeling
              approach was used; starting with Bayesian Generalized Linear
              Mixed Effects modeling followed by Conditional Random Forest for
              classification. Vowels in the pharyngealized context were more
              open (higher F1, Z1-Z0), more back (lower F2, higher Z3-Z2), more
              compact (lower Z2-Z1), and showed spectral divergence (higher
              Z3-Z2). Voice quality results showed these vowels to be produced
              with a tense voice. High classification rates of 93.5\% for JA
              and 91.1\% for MA were obtained and variable importance score
              showed formant-based measures outperform voice quality ones. This

              gesture, as a primary correlate followed by [+constricted

  author   = "Luke, Steven G",
  abstract = "Mixed-effects models are being used ever more frequently in the
              analysis of experimental data. However, in the lme4 package in R
              the standards for evaluating significance of fixed effects in
              these models (i.e., obtaining p-values) are somewhat vague. There
              are good reasons for this, but as researchers who are using these
              models are required in many cases to report p-values, some method
              for evaluating the significance of the model output is needed.
              This paper reports the results of simulations showing that the
              two most common methods for evaluating significance, using
              likelihood ratio tests and applying the z distribution to the
              Wald t values from the model output (t-as-z), are somewhat
              anti-conservative, especially for smaller sample sizes. Other
              methods for evaluating significance, including parametric
              bootstrapping and the Kenward-Roger and Satterthwaite
              approximations for degrees of freedom, were also evaluated. The
              results of these simulations suggest that Type 1 error rates are
              closest to .05 when models are fitted using REML and p-values are
              derived using the Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite approximations,

              rates even for smaller samples.",

              analysis also requires some care. One simple option, when
              numerically possible, is to fit the full variance-covariance
              structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr, Levy,

              Andalusian Spanish provides an opportunity to study this issue.

               /-s/ is nearly accomplished (Vida-Castro, 2004). However, when
               word-medial /-s/ is followed by the voiceless dental
               plosive-phoneme /t/ (e.g. /ˈpasta/ `dough'), two different
               realizations involving the modification of the following context
               alternate: first, one that can be referred to as
               `postaspiration' [th] and second, a dental affricate variant
               [ts] ([ˈpatsa] `dough' instead of the standard [´pasta]). This
               last realization can easily merge with the palatal affricate

               the result of an ongoing linguistic change consisting in
               resyllabification of word-medial /-s/. Evidence of this process
               has also been found in closelyrelated areas of Andalusian

               when followed by the voiceless-dental plosive phoneme /t/, in

               analyse the stylistic and social dimension of the process, based
               on data taken from a representative sample of speakers,
               stratified according to three social variables: age, sex and
               educational level; and, finally, (3) to compare the acoustic
               features of the syllable-final /-s/ affricate variant [ts] with
               those from the palatal affricate phoneme /ʧ/, in order to check
               if minimal lexical pairs containing these sounds could probably

               challenges when we perceive a speaker's intended message.
               Apparently effortlessly, we accommodate variability in talker
               characteristics, dialect, speaking rate, and acoustic
               environment, all of which perturb the mapping between speech and
               linguistic categories. Without the aid of invariant cues to
               phonetic categories or word boundaries, we map acoustics onto
               phonetic categories, phonetic categories onto words in memory,
               words onto phrases and syntactic structures, words and syntax
               onto semantics, etc. Or do we? On this view of language
               understanding, spoken word recognition is a distinct subsystem
               providing the interface between low-level perception and
               cognitive processes of retrieval, parsing, and interpretation.
               The narrowest conception of the process of recognizing a spoken
               word is that it starts from a string of phonemes, establishes
               how these phonemes should be grouped to form words, and passes
               these words onto the next level of processing. Some theories,
               though, take a broader view and blur the distinctions between
               speech perception, spoken word recognition, and sentence
               processing (e.g., Elman, 2004; Gaskell \& Marslen-Wilson, 1997;

               lexical decision experiments with a masked priming technique
               that examined whether syllabic effects are phonological or
               orthographic in nature. In all cases, primes were nonwords. In
               Experiment 1, latencies to CV words were faster when primes and
               targets shared the first syllable (ju.nas-JU.NIO) than when they
               shared the initial letters but not the first syllable
               (jun.tu-JU.NIO). In Experiment 2, this syllabic overlap could be
               phonological+orthographical (vi.rel-VI.RUS) or just phonological
               (bi.rel-VI.RUS). A syllable priming effect was found for CV
               words in both the phonological+orthographical and the
               phonological condition. In Experiment 3 we compared a

               control conditions (fi.rel-VI.RUS and vir.ga-VI.RUS). We found

              the first and the second syllable during speech production in
              Spanish. Facilitative effects of syllable frequency with
              disyllabic words have been reported in Dutch and Spanish (Levelt
              \& Wheeldon, 1994; Perea \& Carreiras, 1998). In both cases, the
              syllable frequency effect was independent of-and additive to-the

              found that words ending in a high-frequency syllable were named
              faster than words ending in a low-frequency syllable, whereas

              of disyllabic CV.CV pseudowords. In Experiment 3, participants

  author    = "Carreiras, Manuel and Baquero, Silvia and Rodr{\'\i}guez,
               Esperanza",
  abstract  = "Background: Over the last decade Carreiras and colleages have
               assembled compelling empirical evidence that the syllable plays
               an important role in the visual recognition of polysyllabic
               words in Spanish. One of the clearest demonstrations of this is
               the syllable frequency effect: Words with high?frequency
               syllables are responded to more slowly than words with
               low?frequency syllables. Another key finding is the syllable
               congruency effect that has been obtained using the masked
               priming technique: Word recognition is facilitated by primes
               that correspond to the first syllable, relative to primes that
               contain one letter more or less than the first syllable. Aims:
               The study aimed to investigate the syllable frequency effect and
               the syllable congruency effect in Alzheimer patients, elderly
               people, and young adults. The goal was to examine whether and to
               what extent syllabic processing is preserved or deteriorates
               with age and/or this disease. If structural components of
               language are to some extent preserved in Alzheimer's disease
               (AD) patients and in elderly people, they should show the
               syllable congruency effect. If AD patients and elderly people
               have a breakdown in the ability to inhibit partially activated
               information, the syllable frequency effect may well turn out to
               be different in these two groups as compared to the young
               adults. Methods \& Procedures: Two experiments, one
               investigating the syllable frequency effect and the other the
               syllable congruency effect, were carried out with Alzheimer
               patients, elderly people, and young adults. In Experiment 1 we
               used the same materials and procedure used by Carreiras and
               Perea (2002) in their Experiment 4. In Experiment 2 we created
               new materials manipulating syllable frequency (high and low) and
               word frequency (high and low). AD patients, elderly people, and
               young controls participated in the two experiments. Outcomes \&
               Results: The results showed syllable congruency effects,
               replicating previous findings. However, syllable frequency
               effects were different for the three groups. Predictably, young
               adults responded more slowly to words with high?frequency
               syllables than to words with low?frequency syllables. In
               contrast, Alzheimer patients and elderly people responded more
               slowly to words with low?frequency syllables than to words with
               high frequency syllables. Conclusions: In the context of
               activation models that take into account a syllabic level of
               representation, the present results suggest that the syllabic
               layer is preserved but the inhibitory process of competition
               between lexical candidates is impaired in Alzheimer patients and
               in elderly people. The research reported in this article has

               experiments using a new paradigm showing that syllabic units
               modulate early ERP components. In Experiment 1, words and
               pseudowords were presented visually and colored so that there
               was a match or a mismatch between the syllable boundaries and
               the color boundaries. The results showed color-syllable
               congruency effects in the time window of the P200. Lexicality
               modulated the N400 amplitude, but no effects of this variable
               were obtained at the P200 window. In Experiment 2, high- and

              illiterates displayed the same incapacity to deal with phonetic
              segments in a detection task and in a progressive free
              segmentation task. Their performance was better, although still
              inferior to that of ex-illiterates, on both deletion and
              detection when the critical unit was a syllable rather than a
              consonant, as well as in a task of rhyme detection. No
              significant difference was observed in a task of melody
              segmentation, on which both groups performed poorly. The high
              specificity of the differences in performance level implies that
              they cannot result to an important extent from differences in
              general ability or motivation between the two groups of subjects.
              They rather mean that while sensitivity to rhyme and analysis
              into syllables can develop up to some point in the absence of the
              experience normally provided by reading instruction, analysis
              into phonetic segments requires that experience. Finally, in a
              picture memory task, the illiterates showed a phonological
              similarity effect, which is consistent with other results
              suggesting that the use of phonological codes for short-term
              retention does not require explicit phonetic analysis.",

              syllable has a hierarchical internal structure. Its primary
              constituents, according to the model, are the onset and the rime.
              The onset contains the initial consonant or consonant cluster.
              The rime contains the peak (vowel nucleus) and coda (`nal
              consonant or cluster). The psychological validity of this model
              was tested in seven experiments involving novel word games. The
              results provided strong support for the validity of onset and
              rime. Adults preferred rules that referred to these units over
              rules that referred to other units. Further, they learned rules
              that kept the onset and the rime intact more easily than rules
              that divided these units. The experiments did not find strong
              support f7r the notion that the rime is subdivided into peak and
              coda. Taken together, the results show that there is at least one

              that morae may intervene as structural units in word recognition.
              First, we found that traditional puns more often substituted part
              of a mora than a whole mora. Second, when listeners reconstructed
              distorted words, e.g. panorama from panozema, responses were
              faster and more accurate when only a phoneme was distorted
              (panozama, panorema) than when a whole CV mora was distorted
              (panozema). Third, lexical decisions on the same nonwords were
              better predicted by duration and number of phonemes from nonword

              For each of stress-, syllable- and mora-based rhythmic structure,
              perceptual experiments have led to the discovery of corresponding
              segmentation procedures. In the case of mora-based rhythm,
              similar segmentation has been demonstrated in the otherwise
              unrelated languages Japanese and Telugu; segmentation based on
              syllable rhythm, however, has been previously demonstrated only
              for European languages from the Romance family. We here report
              two target detection experiments in which Korean listeners,

              phonemes (such as [lv] and [mr] in Dutch) never occur within the
              same syllable, they cue syllable boundaries, and hence possible
              word boundaries. Dutch listeners found it easier to detect words
              at the beginnings of nonsense sequences when the words were
              aligned with a phonotactic boundary (e.g.,pil,pill, in
              [pil.vrem]) than when they were misaligned (e.g.,pilin
              [pilm.rem]). This effect was stronger for words at the ends of
              nonsense sequences (e.g.,rok,skirt, in [fim.rɐk] and [fi.drɐk]).
              Two control experiments indicated that although part of this

               both the Spanish language and the general principles that
               underlie the modern generative theories of linguistics. In this
               book, he outlines important new results that impose strong
               constraints on the theory of Spanish phonology, with
               consequences beyond Spanish and beyond the family of Romance
               languages. The first part of the book deals with problems of
               syllable structure, and the second part with stress
               (accentuation). In both, Harris presents evidence and arguments
               showing that previous analyses are descriptively and
               theoretically inadequate, and he proposes new interpretations.
               These include a proposition for analyzing syllable structure by
               combining a set of rules that apply to strings of phonemes and a
               set of filters that mark labeled constituents as deviant under
               specified conditions. Harris provides a systematic description
               of the stress contours of Spanish words that follows from
               morphological and markedness considerations. Markedness is in
               turn interpreted in terms of the universal theory of
               ``extrametricality.'' The book formulates and illustrates the
               Peripherality Condition, a universal principle that strongly
               constrains the theory of extrametricality, with highly desirable

              First, we argue that the rules creating well-formed syllable
              structure, hence syllabification itself, must apply cyclically.
              Second, a reduplication pattern of this dialect provides support
              for the theory of Prosodic Morphology (McCarthy and Prince

              straightforwardly characterized in prozodic terms, but not
              segmentally. Third, we suggest that Ilokano exhibits
              `antitransfer', i.e. the copying of a glide as a vowel in
              reduplication, and discuss the implications of Ilokano

               the notion that stress constitutes linguistic rhythm---that
               stress patterns are rhythmically organized, and that formal
               structures proposed for rhythm can provide a suitable account of
               stress. Through an extensive typological survey of word stress
               rules that uncovers widespread asymmetries, he identifies a
               fundamental distinction between iambic and trochaic rhythm,
               called the ``Iambic/Trochaic law,'' and argues that it has
               pervasive effects among the rules and structures responsible for
               stress. Hayes incorporates the iambic/trochaic opposition into a
               general theory of word stress assignment, intended to account
               for all languages in which stress is assigned on phonological as
               opposed to morphological principles. His theory addresses
               particularly problematic areas in metrical work, such as ternary
               stress and unusual weight distinctions, and he proposes new
               theoretical accounts of them. Attempting to take more seriously
               the claim of generative grammar to be an account of linguistic
               universals, Hayes proposes analyses for the stress patterns of
               over 150 languages. Hayes compares his own innovative views with

               inhibitory control recruitment during bilingual language

               co-activation and nonlinguistic inhibitory control abilities in

               model for bilingual word recognition which assumes an integrated

               simulations with the BIA model are presented that account for
               the effects of lexical competitors from the same and another
               language on target word recognition in two different paradigms.
               First, the model simulates recent lexical decision results
               obtained with French/English bilinguals in two masked
               orthographic priming experiments (Bijeljac-Babic, Biardeau, \&
               Grainger, 1997). Differences in the result patterns for subject
               groups varying in second-language (L2) proficiency
               (monolinguals, beginning, and more advanced bilinguals) are
               simulated by assuming a reduced frequency range for L2-words. In
               demonstrating that the monolingual participants in this study
               very likely knew some L2-words, the model displays considerable
               heuristic value. Second, the BIA model simulates the effects of
               intra- and interlingual neighborhood density on target word
               recognition in blocked and mixed progressive demasking (PDM)
               with Dutch/English bilinguals (Van Heuven, Dijkstra, \&
               Grainger, 1998). The model accounts for a shift in result
               patterns observed in high-proficiency subjects over parts of the
               blocked PDM experiment by varying the degree of asymmetric
               cross-language inhibition from language node to word level.
               Finally, the model simulates the over-all result pattern in the
               mixed PDM experiment by manipulation of both cross-language
               inhibition and the frequency range for L2- items. A comparison
               with some other nonselective and selective access models
               indicates that the BIA model produces better overall simulation
               results because the two mechanisms allow the model to capture
               the asymmetric cross-language effects observed in unbalanced
               bilingual participants.",

               desirable on both theoretical and empirical grounds, it could
               create difficulty at the point of lexical selection. If two
               translation equivalent lexical nodes are activated to roughly
               equal levels every time that their shared semantic

               is able to provide a full account of the empirical findings. We

               specific units leads to a dramatic proliferation of units and
               connections, begging the question of whether a more efficient
               approach is possible. Our starting point is the observation that
               models of visual object recognition-including visual word
               recognition-have grappled with the problem of spatial
               invariance, and arrived at solutions other than a
               fully-reduplicative strategy like that of TRACE. This inspires a
               new model of spoken word recognition that combines time-specific
               phoneme representations similar to those in TRACE with
               higher-level representations based on string kernels: temporally
               independent (time invariant) diphone and lexical units. This
               reduces the number of necessary units and connections by several
               orders of magnitude relative to TRACE. Critically, we compare
               the new model to TRACE on a set of key phenomena, demonstrating
               that the new model inherits much of the behavior of TRACE and
               that the drastic computational savings do not come at the cost
               of explanatory power.",

               must be mapped rapidly onto words in memory because their
               elements, unlike those of visual words, cannot simultaneously
               exist or persist in time. Although theories agree that the
               dynamics of spoken word recognition are important, they differ
               in how they treat the nature of the competitor set-precisely
               which words are activated as an auditory word form unfolds in
               real time. This study used eye tracking to measure the impact
               over time of word frequency and 2 partially overlapping
               competitor set definitions: onset density and neighborhood
               density. Time course measures revealed early and continuous
               effects of frequency (facilitatory) and on set based similarity
               (inhibitory). Neighborhood density appears to have early
               facilitatory effects and late inhibitory effects. The late
               inhibitory effects are due to differences in the temporal
               distribution of similarity within neighborhoods. The early
               facilitatory effects are due to subphonemic cues that inform the
               listener about word length before the entire word is heard. The
               results support a new conception of lexical competition
               neighborhoods in which recognition occurs against a background
               of activated competitors that changes over time based on
               fine-grained goodness-of-fit and competition dynamics.",

              Repetition priming effects in lexical decision tasks are stronger
              for low-frequency words than for high-frequency words. This
              frequency attenuation effect creates problems for
              frequency-ordered search models that assume a relatively stable
              frequency effect. It was posited that frequency attenuation is a
              product of the involvement of the episodic memory system in the
              lexical decision process. This hypothesis was supported by the
              demonstration of constant repetition effects for high- and
              low-frequency words when the priming stimulus was masked; the
              masking was assumed to minimize the influence of any possible
              episodic trace of the prime. It was further shown that long-term
              repetition effects were much less reliable when the S was not
              required to make a lexical decision response to the prime. When a
              response was required, the expected frequency attenuation effect
              was restored. It is concluded that normal repetition effects
              consist of 2 components: a very brief lexical effect that is
              independent of frequency and a long-term episodic effect that is
              sensitive to frequency. (32 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

              phonemes in different serial positions inside word or nonword
              stimuli was manipulated by varying the probability that a target
              phoneme occurred in the various positions. In our experiments,
              French and Spanish subjects had to detect targets that appeared
              either in the coda of the first syllable or in the onset of the
              second syllable of carrier words. Subjects′ expectations about
              the structural position of the target were manipulated. In a
              series of five experiments (two using a decision paradigm and
              three using a detection paradigm), these expectations were shown
              to influence response latencies: that is, subjects who attended
              to the coda of the first syllable were faster when the target
              appeared in this position rather than in the onset of the second
              syllable; the reverse pattern was observed when subjects attended
              to the onset of the second syllable. This result held regardless
              of the serial position of the target. These results were equally
              valid for French and Spanish. Moreover, syllabification was
              present when Spanish pseudowords were used as carriers. The fact
              that subjects could focus their attention on a syllabically
              defined position, even when processing nonwords, suggests that
              syllabic information is specified at a prelexical level of

              Andalusian Spanish. An analysis of isolated word productions by
              24 speakers of a Western Andalusian and by 24 of an Eastern
              Andalusian variety each divided into two age groups provided
              evidence for a sound change in progress: younger speakers and
              those of the Western Andalusian variety were more likely to
              produce /st/ with a shorter pre-aspiration and with a longer
              post-aspiration phase than their older and Eastern Andalusian
              counterparts. The results of further between-group duration
              analyses show that the sound change cannot be entirely explained
              by a realignment from an anti-phase to an in-phase timing
              relationship between the closure and glottal opening; they also

              post-aspiration. In order to test whether perceptual factors

  abstract = "This study examines the phenomenon of post-aspirated voiceless
              stops in Western Andalusian Spanish in /s/ + voiceless stop
              sequences. Previous analyses have proposed that the
              post-aspiration arises through a reorganization of the glottal
              spreading gesture for /s/ and the oral constriction gesture for
              the stop. This theory is tested by steadily increasing speakers'
              production rate, which has been shown to trigger spontaneous
              changes in gestural organization in speech and other motor
              activities. Results from the study support the initial
              hypothesis. There is a switch from productions with with
              preaspiration and short VOT to those with long VOT as rate
              increases. Additionally, there is a tradeoff between VOT and
              pre-closure aspiration, indicating they may result from the same
              gesture. Lastly, the variability in production shows a number of

              variation derives from and mirrors interspeaker variation. Style
              is essentially speakers' re- sponse to their audience. In
              audience design, speakers accommodate pri- marily to their
              addressee. Third persons - auditors and overhearers - affect
              style to a lesser but regular degree. Audience design also
              accounts for bilingual or bidialectal code choices. Nonaudience
              factors like topic and setting derive their effect by association
              with addressee types. These style shifts are mainly responsive -
              caused by a situational change. Speakers can also use style as
              initiative, to redefine the existing situation. Initiative style
              is primarily referee design: divergence from the addressee and

  author    = "Amastae, Jon",
  abstract  = "Spanish dialects may differ according to the behavior of voiced
               obstruents following r, l, s, and the glides. For most dialects,
               for example, Mexican, fricatives occur in these environments; in
               some, such as highland Colombian, stops tend to occur. Another
               feature distinguishing dialects is s-aspiration/deletion.
               Several Central American dialects are of particular interest
               because they are both s-aspirating/deleting and stop-conserving
               in the series of postconsonantal environments (Canfield,
               1961/1981). Detailed examination of spirantization in these
               dialects, as well as of the particular question of what occurs
               after /s/ $\rightarrow$ [s] [z] [h] [{\O}] has been nonexistent.
               Obviously, if s is deleted before a voiced obstruent, the
               resulting environment of the obstruent is intervocalic, which is
               a favored environment for spirantization. For this
               investigation, 14 Honduran speakers were interviewed using
               standard sociolinguistic interview techniques. Tokens were
               transcribed and categorized according to whether
               s-aspiration/deletion had applied, whether spirantization had
               applied, and by preceding/following environment. It is shown
               that (a) in Honduran Spanish the group r, l, glides, and s
               inhibit spirantization variably, much as they do in highland
               Colombian Spanish; (b) neither voicing, aspiration, nor deletion
               of (s) favor spirantization, despite the apparently favorable
               (surface) environment created when deletion applies; (c) even
               though an analysis of (b) that orders spirantization before
               deletion is apparently explanatory, a view that attributes
               spirantization to syllable structure offers a more comprehensive
               explanation of what happens when the two variable processes
               intersect by applying to adjacent segments.",

              compression effects, whereby, in syllables with a greater number
              of segments, each one of the segments is shorter than in
              syllables with fewer segments. The experiment demonstrates that
              the amount of vowel compression found in English monosyllabic
              words depends in part on which consonants occur adjacent to the
              vowel in that word, how many consonants occur, and in which
              position they occur. Consonant clusters drive more vowel
              shortening than singletons when they involve liquids, but not
              when they involve only obstruents. Clusters involving nasals
              drive shortening relative to singletons only in onset position.
              We suggest that the results cannot be reduced to general
              principles of gestural overlap and coordination between

  abstract  = "The literature on phonological variation and change abounds with
               studies about syllable- and word-final /s/ reduction in Spanish.
               In fact, ``the aspiration and deletion of /s/ in dialects of
               Spanish may be the most extensively treated of all sound changes
               being investigated from an empirical, variationist perspective''
               (Ferguson, 1990, p. 64). Many factors have been shown to
               significantly affect this linguistic phenomenon. Terrell (1979)
               finds word length to be a significant factor in his Cuban data,
               with more deletion in polysyllabic words than in monosyllabic
               ones. Additionally, Terrell shows that redundant plural markers
               in noun phrases (that is, all but the first plural marker) are
               prone to deletion, such as the /s/ in muchas, luchas, and
               internas in the phrase ``...por las muchas luchas internas''
               `...because of the many internal struggles' (p. 605, my
               translation). Besides word length, prosodic stress has been
               shown to be a significant factor. Alba (1982) demonstrates that
               syllable- and word-final /s/ is reduced more often in unstressed
               syllables than in stressed ones. This finding concurs with what
               is known about reductive processes in general, that is, that
               phonetic reduction is more likely in unstressed syllables than
               in stressed one. In fact, longer and larger articulatory
               gestures can be considered part of the definition of a stressed
               syllable (Hualde, 2005). Finally, one factor has been shown
               almost invariably to have the strongest conditioning effect on
               syllable- and word-final /s/ reduction: the following
               phonological context. Lipski (1984) shows that across fifteen
               dialects of Latin American Spanish, in general, word-final /s/
               is reduced most before a consonant, less so before a vowel, and
               least before a pause. In addition to these linguistic factors,
               several extralinguistic factors have also been shown to
               significantly constrain syllable- and word-final /s/ reduction.
               Alba (2003) shows that the level of formality of the
               communicative situation in which the speech is produced
               significantly conditions reduction, with more reduction in less
               formal situations. Additionally, Alba shows that the
               socioeconomic class of the speaker is influential, with more
               reduction among lower-class speakers. Fonetanella de Weinberg
               (1973) demonstrates that the sex of the speaker also contributes
               to reduction, with, in general, more reduction in men's speech.
               Finally, the geographic origin of the speaker greatly influences
               the level of syllable- and word-final /s/ reduction.
               Traditionally, dialectologists (see Zamora Vicente, 1970) have
               classified Spanish dialects according to the overall rate of
               syllable- and word-final /s/ reduction, making a distinction
               between Tierras Altas `High Lands' and Tierras Bajas `Low
               Lands,' which Tierras Altas displaying relatively low levels of
               reduction and Tierras Bajas displaying high levels of reduction.
               This terminology is based on general trends observable in Latin
               American Spanish where syllable- and word-final /s/ reduction is
               the common in the Caribbean Basin and coastal areas, but
               uncommon in highland areas, such as central Mexico and the
               Andean regions of South America. Despite the many studies that
               document syllable- and word-final /s/ reduction in Spanish, the
               lexical frequency of the word in which /s/ occurs has only
               recently been addressed in the literature. Brown \& Torres
               Cacoullos (2002, 2003) show that final /s/ is reduced more often
               in high-frequency words than in low-frequency ones in the speech
               of four men in Chihuahua, Mexico, but only in wordfinal
               position. Brown (2004) finds the opposite effect in traditional
               New Mexican Spanish: lexical frequency is more influential in
               word-internal position than in word-final position. Minnick Fox
               (2006) also finds a significant effect from lexical frequency in
               word-internal position but not in word-final position in fifteen
               dialects of Latin American Spanish. Further, File-Muriel (2007)
               reports that lexical frequency is a significant conditioning
               factor in the reduction of word-internal, syllable-final /s/ in
               Barranquilla, Colombia. This paper contributes to this small,
               but growing, body of literature documenting the influence of
               lexical frequency on syllable- and word-final /s/ reduction by
               analyzing another dialect of Colombian Spanish: the spoken
               Spanish of Cali, Colombia. It is hypothesized that syllable- and
               word-final /s/ will be reduced more often in high-frequency
               words than in low-frequency ones in this dialect of Spanish, as
               has been found in other dialects of Spanish (Brown, 2002, 2003;
               Brown, 2004; Minnick Fox, 2006; File-Muriel, 2007). The results
               show that, as expected, syllable- and word-final /s/ is reduced
               more often in high-frequency words than in low-frequency ones.
               Further, the results demonstrate that lexical frequency has a
               stronger effect in word-internal position than in word-final
               position. This paper also shows that, even though lexical
               frequency is a significant factor, the following phonological
               segment is the most influential factor to condition this
               linguistic phenomenon in these data.",

              linguistic features of Asturian into the Spanish of Asturian

               language-specific perceptual routines. Monolingual speakers of
               Spanish and English detected CV and CVC target sequences in
               native and non-native materials. The replication succeeded only
               in the case of Spanish speakers and Spanish materials, where a
               cross-over interaction of target (CV vs CVC sequences) and
               carrier types (CV- vs CVC-syllabitied words) gave evidence of a
               sensitivity to the input's syllabification; no such pattern
               emerged for Spanish speakers and English materials, nor for
               English speakers and materials in either language. For English
               speakers, the consistent finding was for faster performance with
               CVC targets, regardless of the structure of the carrier word.
               Whether or not this is to be interpreted as evidence of
               syllabified input representations is not clear. Analyses of

               determine the basis on which responses are made in the
               monitoring task, and therefore conclude that the case for
               language specificity in perceptual routines has yet to be made.",

               and its replacement by -ra in colonial Latin American Spanish.
               For the past several centuries, the -se form seems to have been
               in retreat in virtually every Spanish dialect and has become
               virtually extinct in its nonperiphrastic form in Latin America.
               This process can be understood as one of the manifestations of a
               larger chain of events affecting the verbal system of Spanish in
               its transition from a medieval to a modern language and
               resulting in the simplification of the verbal paradigm of the
               Spanish subjunctive. Although significant amounts of scholarship
               have been dedicated to each of these processes, we are still
               lacking stud- ies on the circumstances of the disappearance of
               -se in Latin American Spanish, and it is usually assumed that
               this disappearance was a more or less natural consequence of the
               subjunctivization of -ra. In what follows, I will present the
               data on the distribution of nonperiphrastic -ra and -se forms in
               three corpora from New Spain, specifically from central Mexico,
               Chihuahua, and New Mexico, covering the period between 1600 and
               1800. This study aims to determine whether the expansion of -ra
               into the realm of -se was linguistically and/or dialec- tally
               determined. The following analysis shows that the progressive
               dis- appearance of -se in colonial Latin American Spanish
               followed patterns of internal and external conditioning that
               have not yet been portrayed in the literature.",

               exponents of futurity, we show how the incoming form gradually

               to ousting them from the sector. These results confirm that the
               transition period in linguistic change is not abrupt, but
               proceeds as a series of small adjustments, as incoming and
               outgoing variants jockey for position in the system. As a

               required for perceptual categorization. Phones (and phonemes)
               must be rejected as a linguistic memory code due to, at least,
               (a) evidence of indexical information in speech memory, (b) lack

              ambiguity and vagueness suggest that these categories are
              gradable. That is, whether a given distinction in lexical meaning
              amounts to ambiguity can vary across contexts. A computational
              model of the representation of lexical polysemy was applied to
              three nouns, and the verb paint. The model, based on a
              neuropsychologically inspired framework, Adaptive Resonance
              Theory, was applied to judgements and property ratings from 120
              participants. Model results were compared to an independent
              usage-based analysis, and in the case of paint to an earlier
              cognitive linguistic analysis. Good correspondence was found,
              with the model reproducing specific features of those analyses,
              such as the extraction of similar schemata, as well as the key
              general feature of the gradability of ambiguity and vagueness. At
              the same time, the analysis revealed substantial interpersonal
              variability. Additional modelling demonstrated that the
              availability of specific aspects of conceptual knowledge could be
              contextually modified, leading to predicted changes in the
              pattern of ambiguity. Because Adaptive Resonance Theory uses
              elementary neural processing, previously used to successfully
              model cognitive phenomena, the gradability of ambiguity can be

  abstract  = "This article describes some of the basic formal features of
               traditional French songs. Studies of the formal features of
               songs usually focus on one particular aspect of the tunes or the
               lyrics, e.g., the patterning of rhymes. In contrast, I intend to
               provide an overall view, with special attention paid to the way
               texts mesh with melodies. The guiding idea is that the lyrics of
               a song do not have a metrical structure that can be described
               independently of the tune; the regularities that are found in
               song texts are to a large extent mere reflections of the
               structure of the associated tunes. My general outlook is that of
               generative metrics. An issue that will take center stage is that
               of the formal similarities and differences between the texts of
               songs and literary verse. (By ``literary verse'', I mean verse
               that is transmitted in written form and was not composed in
               order to be sung.) The similarities between song lyrics and
               literary verse are obvious. Researchers usually assume,
               explicitly or not, that song lyrics have an inherent metrical
               structure that is analogous to that of literary verse. This is
               what one may call the traditional stance on the structure of
               song lyrics. This is for instance the position taken by Kiparsky
               2006. Kiparsky's position is represented in (1).",

               Gerard Manley Hopkins. We re-examine and amplify a seminal
               analysis of this metre by Kiparsky (1989). We coded the sprung
               rhythm corpus for stress, weight and phrasing, then used a
               computer program to locate every scansion compatible with
               Kiparsky's analysis. The analysis appears to be nearly

               ambiguity of scansion be minimised, and suggest that under this

               patterns are manifested by phonological material in verse.
               Metrics and phonology are closely related fields whose
               interaction is yielding increasingly important results. This
               chapter outlines some of these findings, as well as directions
               for future research. First, a caveat concerning what this
               chapter is not about. Metrics is only part of the larger field
               of poetics, which studies literature from the structural
               viewpoint adopted in linguistics. Excellent introductions to
               poetics may be found in Jakobson (1960) and Kiparsky (1973). I
               will also bypass work on metrics that is not focussed on the
               link to linguistic structure and to phonology in particular. The
               annotated bibliography of Brogan (1980) is recommended as a
               guide to such work. A good place to start is to establish what
               questions linguists should try to answer in studying metrics;
               this defines the basic research strategy. To my mind the most
               compelling proposal has been the 'generative metrics' originated
               in the 1960s by Halle and Keyser (cf. Halle \& Keyser 1969;
               Keyser 1969; and especially Halle \& Keyser 1971). Generative
               metrics focusses on the problem of well-formedness. We assume
               that a meter is an abstract rhythmic form, internalized by those
               who command the relevant metrical tradition. Participants in a
               tradition share a tacit set of rules which determine which
               phonological sequences of their language constitute well-formed
               instantiations of a meter. Such sequences are termed metrical,

  abstract  = "Halle and Lerdahl (1993) lay out the problem of textsetting:
               when singers encounter a novel stanza for a song that they know,
               they have consistent intuitions about where the syllables of the
               stanza ought to be aligned in time when the new stanza is sung.
               In other words, people have productive textsetting ability.
               Halle and Lerdahl's work offers the first explicit proposal for
               modeling this ability. The present paper likewise proposes a
               formal model of textsetting, but using a different theoretical
               approach. I argue that many well-formed textsettings represent
               the best possible resolution between conflicting metrical
               principles. These involve: (a) matching of stress to strong
               position; (b) avoidance of long lapses (sequences where no
               syllable is initiated); (c) avoidance of extreme syllable
               compression; and (d) alignment of phonological phrase boundaries
               with line boundaries. A good textsetting often must sacrifice
               perfect realization of one of these goals in order to satisfy
               another goal that takes higher priority. For instance, many
               lines place stressed syllables in weaker rhythmic positions, and
               stressless syllables in stronger positions, in order to avoid a
               long syllable lapse, thus sacrificing (a) to satisfy (b). I
               formalize this approach under Optimality Theory (Prince and
               Smolensky 1993/2004). Using data from Hayes and Kaun (1996), in
               which native English speakers spontaneously set many lines of
               verse, I show that an approach based on constraint conflict
               offers considerable improvement in the accuracy with which
               native speakers' settings are predicted.",

               approaches to style, beginning with Labov's Attention to Speech
               approach, in which speech style is contingent on the relative
               formality of the speech situation and hence chiefly reactive;
               Bell's Audience Design approach, in which style shifts are
               conditioned primarily by one's audience; and the Speaker Design
               approach, in which the focus is on speakers' creative use of
               stylistic resources to shape and re-shape identities,
               situations, social structures, and societal belief systems.
               These three approaches to stylistic variation can be correlated
               with Eckert's ?three waves of variation study?. In particular,
               ?third wave? study moves quantitative sociolinguistics from its
               traditional focus on how linguistic variants correlate with
               social categories to how speakers use language to make social
               meanings in unfolding discourse via stylistic variation. Despite
               many insights that have emerged from third wave/Speaker Design

  abstract  = "This article discusses the applicability of the notion of speech
               community in urban centres where considerable dialect mixing
               takes place. The model examined is that of Labov, whose views on
               the speech community have remained remarkably constant. The
               reason for the choice of this model is its testability. Four
               speech community criteria, derived from Labov's work, are
               examined; these are (1) the nativeness of speech community
               members; (2) the presence of uniform patterns of linguistic
               variation; (3) the shared evaluation of linguistic features; and
               (4) the close relatedness of the varieties on all linguistic
               levels. The test bed is Bergen, in western Norway, a city with a
               strongly localised language variety and a linguistically clearly
               identifiable (and stereotyped) rural migrant minority. A range
               of approaches to the linguistic data are taken, including a
               dialect perception test. The data for both the ?native?and the
               rural migrant groups show that each forms a separate speech
               community according to some or all of the criteria. Moreover, it
               is also shown that the rural migrants?language variation is only
               interpretable against the background of the group's relationship
               with the host community. This leads to the presentation of a
               two-tiered speech community model. The higher tier subsumes all
               the groups found in a particular population centre; this tier is
               not necessarily ?Labovian?according to any of the criteria
               listed, but the language variation found within it will be
               interrelated in some way. The lower tier consists of a number of
               ?Labovian?communities, which will include the ?natives?of an

               in San Luis Potos{\'\i}, Mexico, in light of previous research
               on women's speech in language change. It is demonstrated that
               assibilation, an innovation known to have first appeared in the
               speech of women of the middle and upper social echelons, is
               closely associated with sex, sociocultural level, and attitude
               toward traditional male and female roles. These attitudes are
               suggested as a factor that plays an important role in the
               dynamics of the change, showing opposite effects among young men
               and women. That is, young men with traditional attitudes
               assibilate least, whereas young women with traditional attitudes
               assibilate most frequently. Parallels between this study and one
               of a similar innovation in Argentinian Spanish suggest a
               generalized pattern of change in which variables introduced by
               women of the middle and upper social echelons become markers of
               gender display in the lower classes, where they grow to be
               favored by women and avoided by men. The discovery of the role
               of attitude toward traditional sex roles in this pattern of
               change is unique to the present study.",

               description of individual speech usage and group cohesion or
               susceptibility to change in terms of the social network. Based
               on linguistic variable types, this model has a hierarchy of four
               nested fields (speech community configurations) into which each
               individual is placed, according to his/her demonstrated
               recognition of the social evaluation associated with the
               variables. At the most local configuration, speakers demonstrate
               no knowledge of generally stigmatized variables; in the second,
               speakers register an awareness of stigmatized variables; in the

              strategies within Italian and Dutch noun phrases (NPs). Its goal
              is not only to gain insight into what speakers do, but also into
              how listeners' perception and interpretation of incoming speech
              in different languages is affected by the distribution of
              accents. To this end, use is made of a particular experimental
              paradigm, which makes it possible to compare accent patterns in
              different languages from an acoustic, perceptual and functional
              point of view. Accent patterns were obtained via a simple
              dialogue game played by eight Dutch speakers and eight Italian
              ones. In this way, target descriptions of all speakers were
              obtained in the following four contexts: all new, single contrast
              in the adjective, single contrast in the noun, and double
              contrast. The accent patterns in these Dutch and Italian
              utterances were then compared in three different studies. Study 1
              looks at accent distribution and finds that, in Dutch, new and
              contrastive information are accented, while given information is
              not; in Italian, distribution is not a significant factor in
              distinguishing information status, since within the elicited NPs
              both adjective and noun are always accented, irrespective of the
              status of the discourse context. Study 2 consists of prominence
              tests to investigate whether the accents differ in the degree of
              perceived emphasis. In Dutch, information status is reflected in
              these prominence differences: single contrastive accents are
              perceived to be the most emphatic, and given words the least
              emphatic. In Italian, it is less clear how gradient differences
              between accents can be linked to aspects of the discourse
              context. Study 3 presents a functional analysis of accent
              patterns exploring whether listeners are able to reconstruct a
              preceding utterance on the basis of prosodic properties of the
              current utterance. While this is possible for Dutch listeners,
              this is not at all the case for Italian listeners.",

               common maxims and stereotyped phrases. Other sentences which
               were less familiar contained, in similar phonetic environments,
               certain test words that also occurred in the stereotyped
               sentences. The test words were ?excised?, i.e., gated out of all
               the sentences, and listening tests were performed by 43
               listeners. Quite apart from these listening tests two
               operational measures of redundancy were derived. One measure was
               based on a Markovian model of perception and readers were asked
               to guess what word n would be after they had read all the words
               through word n?1 in a sentence. The second measure was based on
               the hypothesis that people reserve their final decision on the
               recognition of each word until they perceive an entire sentence.
               Readers read an entire sentence in the midst of which a word was
               represented by a dash. They were then asked to guess what the
               missing word was. Two groups of thirty readers each performed
               these written tests on the sentences from which the test words
               had been excised. Indexes of redundancy were computed for each
               test word from the percent of correct guesses that occurred for
               the two written tests.The results of the listening tests show
               that the intelligibility of the excised words is inversely
               proportional to the redundancy index obtained from the total
               sentence context. Two acoustic correlates of linguistic stress
               (duration and amplitude) were measured for each excised word.
               Stress is also apparently inversely proportional to the sentence
               context redundancy measure. The results of this experiment
               support the hypothesis that both the acoustic realization and
               auditory perception of a given word in a meaningful sentence may
               be a function of the speaker's and listener's knowledge of the
               semantic and grammatical information contained in the entire
               sentence. The experimental results also indicate that, in some
               circumstances, a listener may be able to identify a word only
               after he adapts to the speaker's voice.",

  abstract  = "In a prescient paper Karl Lashley (1951) rejected reflex
               chaining accounts of the sequencing of behavior and argued
               instead for a more cognitive account in which behavioral
               sequences are typically controlled with central plans. An
               important feature of such plans, according to Lashley, is that
               they are hierarchical. Lashley offered several sources of
               evidence for the hierarchical organization for behavioral plans,
               and others afterward provided more evidence for this hypothesis.
               We briefly review that evidence here and then shift from a focus
               on the structure of plans (Lashley's point of concentration) to
               the processes by which plans are formed in real time. Two
               principles emerge from the studies we review. One is that plans
               are not formed from scratch for each successive movement
               sequence but instead are formed by making whatever changes are
               needed to distinguish the movement sequence to be performed next
               from the movement sequence that has just been performed. This
               plan-modification view is supported by two phenomena discovered
               in our laboratory: the parameter remapping effect, and the
               handpath priming effect. The other principle we review is that
               even single movements appear to be controlled with
               hierarchically organized plans. At the top level are the
               starting and goal postures. At the lower level are the
               intermediate states comprising the transition from the starting
               posture to the goal posture. The latter principle is supported
               by another phenomenon discovered in our lab, the end-state
               comfort effect, and by a computational model of motor planning
               which accounts for a large number of motor phenomena.
               Interestingly, the computational model hearkens back to a
               classical method of generating cartoon animations that relies on
               the production of keyframes first and the production of
               interframes (intermediate frames) second.",

              laterals in two contact languages (Catalan and Spanish) as
              produced by two groups of Catalan--Spanish bilinguals
              (Catalan-dominant and Spanish-dominant) residing on Majorca.
              Catalan alveolar laterals have been reported to be ``darker''
              (i.e. velarized) than Spanish ones. Recent sociophonetic research
              has suggested that Catalan and Spanish are gradually converging
              in this phonetic feature due to intensive contact and that
              laterals are sociolinguistically salient in Majorca. This paper
              examines the potential interactions between the social-indexical
              role of laterals in Majorca and the abilities of bilinguals to
              maintain two separate acoustic distributions for laterals in
              their two languages. First, it is shown that bilinguals tend to
              transfer the phonetic features of the sound categories of their
              native language to their non-native one even after having had
              early and extensive exposure to native input in their
              non-dominant language. Second, it is shown that while most
              bilinguals maintain two separate acoustic distributions for the
              laterals in their two languages, some participants do not.
              Social-indexical and cognitive factors that could explain this

               cognitive processes of retrieval, parsing, and interpretation.
               The narrowest conception of the process of recognizing a spoken
               word is that it starts from a string of phonemes, establishes
               how these phonemes should be grouped to form words, and passes
               these words onto the next level of processing. Some theories,
               though, take a broader view and blur the distinctions among
               speech perception, spoken word recognition, and sentence
               processing. The broader view of spoken word recognition has
               empirical and theoretical motivations. One consideration is that
               by assuming that the input to spoken word recognition is a
               string of abstract, phonemic category labels, one implicitly
               assumes that the nonphonemic variability carried on the speech
               signal is not relevant for spoken word recognition and higher
               levels of processing. However, if this variability and detail is
               not random but is lawfully related to linguistic categories, the
               simplifying assumption that the output of speech perception is a
               string of phonemes may actually be a complicating assumption.",

               perception decline, as often shown, but native language speech
               perception skills show improvement, reflecting a facilitative
               effect of experience with native language. The mechanism
               underlying change at this point in development, and the
               relationship between the change in native and non-native speech
               perception, is of theoretical interest. As shown in new data
               presented here, at the cusp of this developmental change,
               infants' native and non-native phonetic perception skills
               predict later language ability, but in opposite directions.
               Better native language skill at 7.5 months of age predicts
               faster language advancement, whereas better non-native language
               skill predicts slower advancement. We suggest that native
               language phonetic performance is indicative of neural commitment
               to the native language, while non-native phonetic performance
               reveals uncommitted neural circuitry. This paper has three
               goals: (i) to review existing models of phonetic perception
               development, (ii) to present new event-related potential data
               showing that native and non-native phonetic perception at 7.5
               months of age predicts language growth over the next 2 years,
               and (iii) to describe a revised version of our previous model,
               the native language magnet model, expanded (NLM-e). NLM-e
               incorporates five new principles. Specific testable predictions
               for future research programmes are described.",

               Some investigations suggest the possibility of a critical period
               during auditory development when exposure to intense noise may
               adversely affect auditory function. Other studies have reported
               no effect of intense noise on the auditory brainstem response of
               fetal sheep. In one recent experiment, auditory brain?stem
               response thresholds were recorded in utero from fetal sheep
               prior to and following an intense broadband noise exposure
               delivered at a developmental period when the ABR was emerging.
               The ABR thresholds recorded from the noise?exposed fetuses, when
               measured over developmental time, were not as sensitive as
               thresholds obtained from age?matched control fetuses. In a

               broadband noise and the cochleae were harvested 20 days later

              1/2-month old American infants were familiarized with two
              different monosyllabic words and subsequently were presented with
              passages which either included or did not include the familiar

              comparable experiment with 6-month-olds provided no indication
              that infants at this age detected the target words in the
              passages. In Experiment 3, a group of 7 1/2-month-olds was
              familiarized with two different non-word targets which differed
              in their initial phonetic segment by only one or two phonetic
              features from words presented in two of the passages. These
              infants showed no tendency to listen significantly longer to the

              sentential contexts rather than in isolation, they still showed

               that drive language scientists to pursue these studies: What are
               the biological underpinnings of language? Why has it proven so
               difficult to build a computer that learns language? Is language

               Once dialectal variation is considered, the difficulty of this

               processing difficulties associated with dialectal variation
               dissipate over time. Through a series of primed lexical decision
               tasks (form priming, semantic priming, and long-term repetition

               listeners with different levels of exposure to the dialect?

              identification usually relies on the comparison between a target
              word preceded by a homophonic prime and an orthographic control
              (rait-RATE vs. raut-RATE). This comparison rests on the
              assumption that the two control primes are equally
              orthographically similar to the target. Here, we tested for
              phonological effects with a masked priming paradigm in which
              orthographic similarity between priming conditions was perfectly
              controlled at the letter level and in which identification of the
              prime was virtually at chance for both stimulus onset
              asynchronies (SOAs) (66 and 50 msec). In the key prime-target
              pairs, each prime differed from the target by one vowel letter,
              but one changed the sound of the initial c, and the other did not
              (cinal-CANAL vs. conal-CANAL). In the control prime-target pairs,
              the primes had the identical vowel manipulation, but neither
              changed the initial consonant sound (pinel-PANEL vs.
              ponel-PANEL). For both high- and low-frequency words, lexical
              decision responses to the target were slower when the prime
              changed the sound of the c than when it did not, whereas there

  abstract = "Changes in the identification of speech sounds following
              selective adaptation are usually attributed to a reduction in
              sensitivity of auditory feature detectors. An alternative
              explanation of these effects is based on the notion of response
              contrast. In several experiments, subjects identified the initial
              segment of synthetic consonant-vowel syllables as either the
              voiced stop [b] or the voiceless stop [ph]. Each test syllable
              had a value of voice onset time (VOT) that placed it near the
              English voiced-voiceless boundary. When the test syllables were
              preceded by a single clear [b] (VOT = -100 msec), subjects tended
              to identify them as [ph], whereas when they were preceded by an
              unambiguous [ph] (VOT = 100 msec), the syllables were
              predominantly labeled [b]. This contrast effect occurred even
              when the contextual stimuli were velar and the test stimuli were
              bilabial, which suggests a featural rather than a phonemic basis
              for the effect. To discount the possibility that these might be
              instances of single-trial sensory adaptation, we conducted a
              similar experiment in which the contextual stimuli followed the
              test items. Reliable contrast effects were still obtained. In
              view of these results, it appears likely that response contrast
              accounts for at least some component of the adaptation effects

               adult participants learned either a unidimensional or a

              stop consonant articulation was investigated in a series of
              experiments. In experiment 1, we preceded synthetic syllables
              from two [tV]--[kV] continua with fricative noises appropriate to
              [integral of] or [s] and showed that more velar stops are
              perceived in the context of [s]. Experiment 1 also demonstrated a
              decrease in the magnitude of this perceptual context effect with
              increased temporal separation of fricative noise and CV portion,
              and with introduction of a vowel before the noise, which
              permitted a subjective syllable boundary after the fricative.
              Experiment 2 showed that although the effect of the fricative on
              stop perception declines initially with temporal separation, it
              may persist in reduced form over intervals as long as 375 ms.
              Experiment 3 replicated the basic fricative context effect using
              improved stimuli, but failed to replicate the reduction with an
              intervening syllable boundary obtained in experiment 1, which
              presumably was due to the vowel preceding the fricative.
              Experiments 4 and 5 revealed that the fricative context effect
              depends both on the phonetic category assigned to the fricative
              and on the specific spectral properties of the fricative noise.
              Experiment 5 also revealed a reciprocal effect of the stop
              consonant on fricative identification. We hypothesize that these

               Monolingual infants likely failed because the bilingual mode of
               presentation increased phonetic variability and did not match
               their real-world input. Experiment 2 tested this hypothesis by
               presenting monolingual infants with nonce word tokens restricted
               to native language pronunciations. Monolinguals succeeded in
               this case. Experiment 3 revealed that the presence of unfamiliar
               pronunciations in Experiment 2, rather than a reduction in

              analysis in a longitudinal study exploring Spanish-English
              bilingual children and the relationships among (a) early brain
              measures of phonetic discrimination in both languages, (b) degree
              of exposure to each language in the home, and (c) children's
              later bilingual word production abilities. Speech discrimination
              was assessed with event-related brain potentials (ERPs). A
              bilingual questionnaire was used to quantify the amount of
              language exposure from all adult speakers in the household, and
              subsequent word production was evaluated in both languages. Our
              results suggest that bilingual infants' brain responses to speech
              differ from the pattern shown by monolingual infants. Bilingual
              infants did not show neural discrimination of either the Spanish
              or English contrast at 6--9 months. By 10--12 months of age,
              neural discrimination was observed for both contrasts. Bilingual
              infants showed continuous improvement in neural discrimination of
              the phonetic units from both languages with increasing age. Group
              differences in bilingual infants' speech discrimination abilities
              are related to the amount of exposure to each of their native
              languages in the home. Finally, we show that infants' later word
              production measures are significantly related to both their early
              neural discrimination skills and the amount exposure to the two
              languages early in development.",

              monolingual and bilingual infants and toddlers. A substantial
              number of behavioral studies have characterized when infants show
              changes in behavior towards speech sounds in relation to amount
              of experience with these sounds. However, these studies cannot
              explain to what extent the developmental timeline is influenced
              by experience with the language versus constraints imposed by
              cortical maturation. Studies using electrophysiological measures
              to examine the development of auditory and speech processing have
              shown great differences in infant and adult electrophysiological
              correlates of processing. Many of these differences are a
              function of immature cortex in the infant. In this paper, we
              examined the maturation of infant and child
              event-related-potential (ERP) electrophysiological components in
              processing an English vowel contrast and explored to what extent
              these components are influenced by intrinsic (e.g., sex) versus

               the native language(s) they must learn. Over the first weeks and
               months of life, infants learn about the sounds and sights of
               their native language, and use that perceptual knowledge to pull
               out words and bootstrap grammar. In this paper, I review
               research showing that infants growing up bilingual learn the
               properties of each of the their two languages simultaneously,
               while nonetheless keeping them apart. Thus, they use perceptual
               learning to break into the properties of each of the two native
               languages. While the fundamental process of language acquisition
               is the same whether one or two languages are being acquired,
               cognitive advantages accrue from the task of language
               separation, and processing costs accrue from the more minimal
               input received in each of the two languages. I conclude by
               suggesting that when there are sufficient cues to which language
               is being used, the cognitive advantages that accrue from
               language separation enable the bilingual infant to move forward

              the lexicon. Here, we expand its mandate by considering infants
              growing up bilingual. We argue that, just like monolinguals,
              bilingual infants have access to rich information in the speech
              stream and by the end of their first year, they establish not
              only language-specific phonetic category representations, but
              also encode and represent both sub-phonetic and indexical detail.
              Perceptual biases, developmental level, and task demands work
              together to influence the level of detail used in any particular

              internal demands imposed by the infant (e.g. different approaches

              their sensitivity to nonnative contrasts declines. Here, we
              consider the case of infants growing up bilingual as a window

              contrasts that occur between their languages. Bilingual infants
              share many classic developmental patterns with monolinguals.
              However, they also show unique developmental patterns in the
              perception of native distinctions such as U-shaped trajectories
              and dose-response relationships, and show some enhanced
              sensitivity to nonnative distinctions. Analogous developmental
              patterns can be observed in individuals exposed to two

               phoneme, the syllable, and the word during speech processing. It
               also presents several studies that tend to show that the
               syllable operates as the basic speech processing device. If this
               assertion turns out to be true, it could have important
               implications. Some recent theories of lexical access, such as
               Marslen wilson's cohort theory, generally assume that left to
               right phoneme sequences determine not only how, but also when
               the listener can make an access to his lexicon. In the chapter's
               view, the syllable will turn out to be a much better device for
               computing cohort sizes than the left to right sequence of
               phonemes. Future work can test the different predictions that
               can be made on issues in lexical access. The chapter also
               considers the relative status of the phoneme and of the syllable
               in the course of language acquisition. Empirical studies will
               clarify whether such rules exist in infant language, and if so,
               how they are learned. If syllables are initially segmented into
               syncretic wholes, then in the course of development they
               probably will be analyzed and classified on the basis of their
               phonetic constituents. Thus, this achievement may, in part, be

              seems that syllable-like sequences act as minimal accessing
              devices in speech processing. Ss are aware in real time of
              syllabic structure in words and respond dif- ferently to words
              with the same initial three phonemes if the segmental one is CV/
              ... and the other CVC/.... Likewise, infants seem to be aware
              that a 'good' syllable must have at least one alternation if it
              is composed of more than one phoneme. When the segment is only
              one phoneme long, its status is necessarily somewhere between
              that of the phoneme and the syllable. An important problem that
              arises with the syllable is that it is an unlikely device for
              speech acquisition. Indeed, there are a few thousand syllables
              and the attribution of a given token to a type is far from
              obvious. Even if physical invariants for syllables in contexts
              were to be found, the task facing the child still remains one of
              sorting thousands of types from many more tokens. Issues

               syllable does not trigger segmentation. We report experiments in
               which listeners detected words embedded in nonsense bisyllables
               more slowly when the bisyllable had two strong syllables than
               when it had a strong and a weak syllable; mint was detected more
               slowly in mintayve than in minlesh. According to our proposed

               successful detection of the embedded word therefore requires
               assembly of speech material across a segmentation position.
               Speech recognition models involving phonemic or syllabic

                 examine whether or not assignment of letter position in a word
                 can be influenced by lexeme boundaries. The experiment was run
                 in Basque, which is a strongly agglutinating language with a
                 high proportion of inflected and compound words. Nonword
                 primes were created by transposing two nonadjacent letters
                 that crossed or did not cross morphological boundaries.
                 Specifically, we compared morphologically complex prime-target
                 pairs (e.g., arbigide-ARGIBIDE) with orthographic controls
                 (e.g., arkipide-ARGIBIDE; note that ARGIBIDE is a compound of

                 examined transposed-letter similarity effects for nonwords
                 created by transposing two nonadjacent letters (e.g.,
                 relovuci{\'o}n-REVOLUCION) in a masked form priming experiment

              resulting segmentation of continuous speech leads to vowelless
              residues in the input-for example, single consonants. Three
              word-spotting experiments investigated segmentation in Slovak, a
              language with single-consonant words and fixed stress. In
              Experiment 1, Slovak listeners detected real words such as ruka
              ``hand'' embedded in prepositional-consonant contexts (e.g.,
              /gruka/) faster than those in nonprepositional-consonant contexts
              (e.g., /truka/) and slowest in syllable contexts (e.g.,
              /dugruka/). The second experiment controlled for effects of
              stress. Responses were still fastest in prepositional-consonant
              contexts, but were now slowest in nonprepositional-consonant
              contexts. In Experiment 3, the lexical and syllabic status of the

              prepositional-consonant, prepositional-vowel, and
              nonprepositional-vowel contexts. These results suggest that
              Slovak listeners use fixed stress and the PWC to segment speech,
              but that single consonants that can be words have a special
              status in Slovak segmentation. Knowledge about what constitutes a
              phonologically acceptable word in a given language therefore

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Research on children's word structure development is
              limited. Yet, phonological intervention aims to accelerate the
              acquisition of both speech-sounds and word structure, such as
              word length, stress or shapes in CV sequences. Until normative
              studies and meta-analyses provide in-depth information on this
              topic, smaller investigations can provide initial benchmarks for
              clinical purposes. AIMS: To provide preliminary reference data
              for word structure development in a variety of Spanish with
              highly restricted coda use: Granada Spanish (similar to many
              Hispano-American varieties). To be clinically applicable, such
              data would need to show differences by age, developmental
              typicality and word structure complexity. Thus, older typically
              developing (TD) children were expected to show higher accuracy
              than younger children and those with protracted phonological
              development (PPD). Complex or phonologically marked forms (e.g.
              multisyllabic words, clusters) were expected to be late
              developing. METHODS \& PROCEDURES: Participants were 59 children
              aged 3-5 years in Granada, Spain: 30 TD children, and 29 with PPD
              and no additional language impairments. Single words were
              digitally recorded by a native Spanish speaker using a 103-word
              list and transcribed by native Spanish speakers, with
              confirmation by a second transcriber team and acoustic analysis.
              The program Phon 1.5 provided quantitative data. OUTCOMES \&
              RESULTS: In accordance with expectations, the TD and older age
              groups had better-established word structures than the younger
              children and those with PPD. Complexity was also relevant: more
              structural mismatches occurred in multisyllabic words, initial
              unstressed syllables and clusters. Heterosyllabic consonant
              sequences were more accurate than syllable-initial sequences. The
              most common structural mismatch pattern overall was consonant
              deletion, with syllable deletion most common in 3-year-olds and
              children with PPD. CONCLUSIONS \& IMPLICATIONS: The current study
              provides preliminary reference data for word structure
              development in a Spanish variety with restricted coda use, both
              by age and types of word structures. Between ages 3 and 5 years,
              global measures (whole word match, word shape match)
              distinguished children with typical versus protracted
              phonological development. By age 4, children with typical
              development showed near-mastery of word structures, whereas 4-
              and 5-year-olds with PPD continued to show syllable deletion and
              cluster reduction, especially in multisyllabic words. The results
              underline the relevance of multisyllabic words and words with
              clusters in Spanish phonological assessment and the utility of
              word structure data for identification of protracted phonological
              development.",

  abstract = "This paper proposes a new experimental paradigm to explore the
              discriminability of languages, a question which is crucial to the
              child born in a bilingual environment. This paradigm employs the
              speech resynthesis technique, enabling the experimenter to
              preserve or degrade acoustic cues such as phonotactics, syllabic
              rhythm, or intonation from natural utterances. English and
              Japanese sentences were resynthesized, preserving broad
              phonotactics, rhythm, and intonation (condition 1), rhythm and
              intonation (condition 2), intonation only (condition 3), or
              rhythm only (condition 4). The findings support the notion that
              syllabic rhythm is a necessary and sufficient cue for French
              adult subjects to discriminate English from Japanese sentences.
              The results are consistent with previous research using low-pass
              filtered speech, as well as with phonological theories predicting
              rhythmic differences between languages. Thus, the new methodology
              proposed appears to be well suited to study language
              discrimination. Applications for other domains of
              psycholinguistic research and for automatic language
              identification are considered.",

              that a sound pattern is a nonword at the point where it deviates
              from all known words. We varied when during the sound pattern the

              could be uniquely identified appeared to influence reaction
              times. The second and third experiments demonstrated that the

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: A fundamental problem in the study of human spoken
              word recognition concerns the structural relations among the
              sound patterns of words in memory and the effects these relations
              have on spoken word recognition. In the present investigation,
              computational and experimental methods were employed to address a
              number of fundamental issues related to the representation and
              structural organization of spoken words in the mental lexicon and
              to lay the groundwork for a model of spoken word recognition.
              DESIGN: Using a computerized lexicon consisting of transcriptions
              of 20,000 words, similarity neighborhoods for each of the
              transcriptions were computed. Among the variables of interest in
              the computation of the similarity neighborhoods were: 1) the
              number of words occurring in a neighborhood, 2) the degree of
              phonetic similarity among the words, and 3) the frequencies of
              occurrence of the words in the language. The effects of these
              variables on auditory word recognition were examined in a series
              of behavioral experiments employing three experimental paradigms:
              perceptual identification of words in noise, auditory lexical
              decision, and auditory word naming. RESULTS: The results of each
              of these experiments demonstrated that the number and nature of
              words in a similarity neighborhood affect the speed and accuracy
              of word recognition. A neighborhood probability rule was
              developed that adequately predicted identification performance.
              This rule, based on Luce's (1959) choice rule, combines stimulus
              word intelligibility, neighborhood confusability, and frequency
              into a single expression. Based on this rule, a model of auditory
              word recognition, the neighborhood activation model, was
              proposed. This model describes the effects of similarity
              neighborhood structure on the process of discriminating among the
              acoustic-phonetic representations of words in memory. The results
              of these experiments have important implications for current
              conceptions of auditory word recognition in normal and hearing
              impaired populations of children and adults.",

              the viability of chunks of the input as possible words. Shortlist
              B is radically different from its predecessor in two respects.
              First, whereas Shortlist was a connectionist model based on
              interactive-activation principles, Shortlist B is based on
              Bayesian principles. Second, the input to Shortlist B is no

              multiple phoneme probabilities over 3 time slices per segment,

  abstract = "We describe a model called the TRACE model of speech perception.
              The model is based on the principles of interactive activation.
              Information processing takes place through the excitatory and
              inhibitory interactions of a large number of simple processing
              units, each working continuously to update its own activation on
              the basis of the activations of other units to which it is
              connected. The model is called the TRACE model because the
              network of units forms a dynamic processing structure called
              ``the Trace,'' which serves at once as the perceptual processing
              mechanism and as the system's working memory. The model is
              instantiated in two simulation programs. TRACE 1. described in
              detail elsewhere. deals with short segments of real speech, and
              suggests a mechanism for coping with the fact that the cues to
              the identity of phonemes vary as a function of context. TRACE II,
              the focus of this article, simulates a large number of empirical
              findings on the perception of phonemes and words and on the
              interactions of phoneme and word perception. At the phoneme
              level, TRACE II simulates the influence of lexical information on
              the identification of phonemes and accounts for the fact that
              lexical effects are found under certain conditions but not
              others. The model also shows how knowledge of phonological
              constraints can be embodied in particular lexical items but can
              still be used to influence processing of novel, nonword
              utterances. The model also exhibits categorical perception and
              the ability to trade cues off against each other in phoneme
              identification. At the word level, the model captures the major
              positive feature of Marslen-Wilson's COHORT model of speech
              perception, in that it shows immediate sensitivity to information
              favoring one word or set of words over others. At the same time,
              it overcomes a difftculty with the COHORT model: it can recover
              from underspecitication or mispronunciation of a word's
              beginning. TRACE II also uses lexical information to segment a
              stream of speech into a sequence of words and to find word
              beginnings and endings, and it simulates a number of recent
              findings related to these points. The TRACE model has some
              limitations, but we believe it is a step toward a psychologically
              and computationally adequate model of the process of speech
              perception.",

              Two groups of college students who were learning to read English
              as a second language (ESL) were examined for their relative
              reliance on phonological and orthographic processing in English
              word identification: Korean students with an alphabetic L1
              literacy background, and Chinese students with a nonalphabetic L1
              literacy background. In a semantic category judgment task, Korean
              ESL learners made more false positive errors in judging stimuli
              that were homophones to category exemplars than they did in
              judging spelling controls. However, there were no significant
              differences in responses to stimuli in these two conditions for
              Chinese ESL learners. Chinese ESL learners, on the other hand,
              made more accurate responses to stimuli that were less similar in
              spelling to category exemplars than those that were more similar.
              Chinese ESL learners may rely less on phonological information
              and more on orthographic information in identifying English words
              than their Korean counterparts. Further evidence supporting this
              argument came from a phoneme deletion task in which Chinese
              subjects performed more poorly overall than their Korean
              counterparts and made more errors that were phonologically
              incorrect but orthographically acceptable. We suggest that
              cross-writing system differences in L1s and L1 reading skills

               have demonstrated that the prevailing metaphor of transfer of
               skills is misleading, and that what happens is access to an
               already existing general cognitive skill. There is evidence in
               first language (L1) and in L2 that accessing this skill when
               reading in an alphabetic language involves efficient use of
               verbal working memory (VWM). This article reports a study of a
               component of VWM, the phonological loop, which serves to hold
               recently read material available in a phonological form. The
               study investigated whether the unreliability of learners' mental
               L2 phonological inventories contributed to reading comprehension
               problems. Lower intermediate learners with L2 reading
               comprehension problems attempted to recall similar and
               dissimilar sequences of words in L1 (French) and L2 (English).
               Their performance was consistent with their having unreliable L2

               English as a second language. Developmentally, tasks of
               visual-orthographic skill, phonological awareness, and
               morphological awareness improved with age. However, the extent
               to which each of the constructs explained variance in Chinese
               and English word reading was stable across age but differed by
               orthography. Across grades, visual-orthographic skills and
               morphological awareness, but not phonological awareness, were
               uniquely associated with Chinese character recognition with age
               and nonverbal IQ statistically controlled. In contrast, Chinese
               visual-orthographic skills and phonological awareness, but not

               Chinese children are taught in school to read both Chinese and
               English using a ``look and say'' strategy that emphasizes visual

              Franceschina, 2004) and that they process only superficial
              structures (Clahsen and Felser, 2006), due to a maturationally
              constrained critical period for L2 acquisition. In contrast,

              goal of this study was to investigate the interplay between
              domain knowledge and one such factor: working memory capacity.
              Adults from wide ranges of working memory capacity, age, and

              answered questions about, simulated radio broadcasts of baseball

               first language, and second and foreign language (L2/FL) settings
               has increased. Reading fluency, in which readers decode and
               comprehend at the same time, is critical to successful reading.
               Fluent readers are accurate and fast in their ability to
               recognize words, and in their use of prosodic and syntactic
               knowledge to better comprehend text. Reading is a significant
               and viable means of developing L2/FL ability, particularly in FL
               settings in which L2 input sources are limited, such as Vietnam
               or Japan (for English as a foreign language), or the USA (for
               Japanese or Russian as a foreign language).Yet many L2/FL
               learners read slowly and laboriously, likely because of poor
               word recognition skills. Repeated reading (RR) is one method of
               fluency-building long used in first language (L1) settings and
               more recently in L2/FL settings, and seems successful in
               increasing the reading fluency and comprehension of both L1 and
               L2/FL learners. Nonetheless, it is likely that teachers and
               learners in L2/FL settings may be unaware of or unconvinced of
               the role increased reading fluency plays in reading
               comprehension and, as a result, may not see the utility of
               devoting class or personal time to repeated reading or, indeed,
               any reading fluency activity. Because quantitative evidence for
               positive effects of RR has already been offered (see Taguchi,
               Sasamoto, Gorsuch \& Taguchi, 2008), we offer additional
               evidence in the form of open-ended, post-reading student reports
               written over the length of an 11-week RR treatment for 30 young
               adult EFL learners in Vietnam. Iterative analyses of over 200
               pages of student reports provided nuanced evidence of the
               positive effects RR has on FL learners? reading fluency and
               comprehension development, and general language development.
               Learners? comments revealed information that suggested a
               meaningful role for extended experience with RR to increasing
               use of learner metacognition in reading strategy use, and
               growing awarenesses on the part of learners of (1) the

              acquisition and reading comprehension. In this paper, we report
              on a study of 13 students in a second-year German language course
              who read a German short story on a multimedia CD-ROM. They had
              access to multimedia annotations of difficult vocabulary words,
              and their actions were tracked while they looked up words and
              completed a vocabulary test and comprehension exercises. In order
              to assess their working memory capacity, they completed a nonword
              repetition test and a reading span test. Analyses suggest a
              relationship between phonological working memory (nonword
              repetition test) and the number of look-ups, with those
              individuals with lower verbal WM capacity looking up more words.

  abstract  = "Military sociologists have relied on a theory which is grounded
               in the universalistic standard argument to explain black
               inequality in the Army. This argument, which is a component part
               of the institutional racism perspective, argues that blacks do
               not do as well as whites in the Army because of their failure to
               do well on universalistic criteria such as civilian education or
               the Armed Forces Qualification Test. Taking promotion time as a
               measure of inequality, this paper presents data which suggest
               that universalistic criteria are not sufficient to explain black
               inequality vis-{\`a}-vis promotion time. When black and white

               grade than whites. The findings suggest the salience of the
               notion of ascription: when ascription is based on race, it
               becomes a component part of racism. Thus, one unavoidably is led
               by the data in this paper to conclude that the black enlisted
               man is subject to inequality, which is not the result of failure

              children?",
  author   = "Leathers, Sonya J and Spielfogel, Jill E and Gleeson, James P and
              Rolock, Nancy",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Adoption is particularly important for foster
              children with special mental health needs who are unable to
              return home, as adoption increases parental support often
              critically needed by youth with mental health issues.
              Unfortunately, significant behavior problems frequently inhibit
              foster parents from adopting, and little is known about factors
              that predict adoption when a child has behavior problems.
              Previous research suggests that foster parent behavioral training
              could potentially increase rates of successful adoptions for
              pre-school-aged foster children with behavior problems (Fisher,
              Kim, \& Pears, 2009), but this has not been previously tested in
              older samples. In older children, effective treatment of behavior
              problems might also increase adoption by reducing the
              interference of behavior problems and strengthening the child's
              foster home integration. This pilot study focused on this
              question by testing associations between behavior problems,
              foster home integration, an evidence-based foster parent
              intervention, and adoption likelihood. METHODS: This study used
              an intent-to-treat design to compare foster home integration and
              adoption likelihood for 31 foster children with histories of
              abuse and neglect whose foster parents received a foster
              behavioral parenting intervention (see Chamberlain, 2003) or
              usual services. Random effect regression analyses were used to
              estimate outcomes across four time points. RESULTS: As expected,
              externalizing behavior problems had a negative effect on both
              integration and adoption, and foster home integration had an
              independent positive effect on adoption. Internalizing behavior
              problems (e.g., depression/anxiety) were not related to adoption
              or integration. However, the intervention did not have a direct
              effect on either foster home integration or adoption despite its
              positive effect on behavior problems. CONCLUSIONS: Results from
              this preliminary study provide further evidence of the negative
              effect of externalizing behavior problems on adoption. Its
              findings also suggest that foster home integration is an
              important dimension of foster home adaptation that appears
              particularly relevant to chances for adoption. While behavior
              problems appear to weaken foster home integration, integration is
              also an independent predictor of adoption likelihood. If these
              results are replicated in a larger study, consideration of foster
              home integration in case planning and future intervention studies
              focused on increasing permanency could potentially improve
              outcomes for foster children with behavior problems.",

               discussed, including the Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis and
               interlanguage. Next, we turn to the acquisition of consonants
               and vowels, which has been the subject of both experimental and
               theoretical investigations. The last section examines the
               acquisition of suprasegmental structure, such as syllables,
               phonotactics, and prosodic position. Several theories that
               elucidate the relative contributions of first language transfer

              Extending these experiments to those with dissimilar inventories
              requires understanding the capacity of speakers to imitate native
              and non-native phones. In the present study, we tested native
              Spanish and native English speakers to determine whether
              imitation of non-native tokens differs qualitatively from
              imitation of native tokens. Participants imitated a [ba]-[pa]
              continuum that varied in VOT from -60 ms (prevoiced, Spanish [b])
              to +60 ms (long lag, English [p]) such that the continuum
              consisted of some tokens that were native to Spanish speakers and
              some that were native to English speakers. Analysis of the
              imitations showed two critical results. First, both groups of
              speakers demonstrated sensitivity to VOT differences in tokens
              that fell within their native regions of the VOT continuum
              (prevoiced region for Spanish and long lag region for English).
              Secondly, neither group of speakers demonstrated such sensitivity
              to VOT differences among tokens that fell in their non-native
              regions of the continuum. These results show that, even in an
              intentional imitation task, speakers cannot accurately imitate
              non-native tokens, but are clearly flexible in producing native
              tokens. Implications of these findings are discussed with
              reference to the constraints on convergence in interlocutors from

               ``Katom'' (Computer for Every Class, Student and Teacher)
               Program, begun in 2004. A three-circle support and training
               model was developed for teachers' professional development. The
               first circle applies to all teachers in the program; the second,
               to all teachers at individual schools; the third to teachers of
               specific disciplines. The study reveals and describes the
               attitudes of science teachers to the integration of laptop
               computers and to the accompanying professional development
               model. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight
               science teachers from the four schools participating in the
               program. The interviews were analyzed according to the internal
               relational framework taken from the information that arose from
               the interviews. Two factors influenced science teachers'
               professional development: (1) Introduction of laptops to the
               teachers and students. (2) The support and training system.
               Interview analysis shows that the disciplinary training is most
               relevant to teachers and they are very interested in belonging
               to the professional science teachers' community. They also
               prefer face-to-face meetings in their school. Among the
               difficulties they noted were the new learning environment,
               including control of student computers, computer integration in
               laboratory work and technical problems. Laptop computers
               contributed significantly to teachers' professional and personal
               development and to a shift from teacher-centered to
               student-centered teaching. One-to-One laptops also changed the
               schools' digital culture. The findings are important for
               designing concepts and models for professional development when

               teachers, but more recently has also been the focus of a growing
               body of research aiming to understand voice as
               self-representation in writing. Adopting a socio-cultural
               orientation to voice, studies have revealed much about how
               textual choices are used by readers to build images of
               text-authors; however, such research has been limited to
               contexts in which the author's actual identity is unknown by the
               reader. Research has offered limited insight into how an authors
               embodied self figures into readers' voice construction, or how
               voice construction is connected to readers' assessments of
               text---with or without knowledge of the author's identity apart
               from the text. This article takes up these issues by exploring
               how readers' exposure to videos of two second language (L2)
               student-authors influenced voice construction and evaluation of
               the students' papers. Through primarily qualitative and
               intertextual analysis, the study concludes that voice
               construction, extra-textual identity, and assessment are related
               and interacting constructs, though these relationships are
               neither straightforward nor predictable. Methodological,

               of analytical frameworks and methodological approaches that are
               loosely labeled as critical discourse analysis (CDA). A
               methodological review of the role of CDA in the field is thus
               timely both to provide signposts for researchers wishing to draw
               on CDA methods in applied linguistics research and to provide

               rapidly growing body of CDA-oriented applied linguistics

               analytic tools that can be inserted into a diverse range of
               theoretical frameworks (e.g., positivist studies, interpretive
               studies, critical studies), CDA cannot be applied divorced from
               its paradigmatic theories, as it is closely related to a
               specific set of social theories about the nature of language,
               literacy, identity, social practice, and the social world. CDA

               recognition and predictors of success in reading. The first

               and low-educated adult readers. The study revealed that the

              during language processing are sometimes just ``good enough'' for
              the task at hand and propose the ``online cognitive equilibrium''
              hypothesis as the driving force behind the formation of
              good-enough representations in language processing. Based on this
              view, we assume that the language comprehension system by default
              prefers to achieve as early as possible and remain as long as
              possible in a state of cognitive equilibrium where linguistic
              representations are successfully incorporated with existing
              knowledge structures (i.e., schemata) so that a meaningful and
              coherent overall representation is formed, and uncertainty is
              resolved or at least minimized. We also argue that the online
              equilibrium hypothesis is consistent with current theories of
              language processing, which maintain that linguistic
              representations are formed through a complex interplay between
              simple heuristics and deep syntactic algorithms and also theories
              that hold that linguistic representations are often incomplete
              and lacking in detail. We also propose a model of language
              processing that makes use of both heuristic and algorithmic
              processing, is sensitive to online cognitive equilibrium, and, we
              argue, is capable of explaining the formation of underspecified
              representations. We review previous findings providing evidence
              for underspecification in relation to this hypothesis and the

              read and write. We critically examine experimental evidence and
              theories of how (il)literacy affects the human mind. In our
              discussion, we show that literacy has significant cognitive
              consequences that go beyond the processing of written words and
              sentences. Thus, cultural inventions such as reading shape
              general cognitive processing in non-trivial ways. We suggest that
              this has important implications for educational policy and
              guidance and research into cognitive processing and brain
              functioning.",

              of letters (Experiment 1) and symbols (Experiment 2) in which the

              that emerges during literacy acquisition and that the recognition
              of sequences of objects is highly modulated by reading skills.
              These data offer new insights about the manner in which reading

              Productions were recorded shortly after the NJ participants'
              arrival in the USA and then one year later. In agreement with
              previous investigations [Aoyama, et al., J. Phon. 32, 233-250
              (2004)], children were able to learn more, leading to higher
              accuracy than adults in a year's time. Based on the spectral
              quality and duration comparisons, NJ adults had more accurate
              production at Time 1, but showed no improvement over time. The NJ

              Japanese /i/ and /a/ showed changes in production that can be

              perceptual training on palatal codas in a pretest--post-test
              design. We compared the effects of training on improvements in
              perception and production for trained and new words and talkers.
              A control group who completed an unrelated perceptual training
              was included for comparison. Results indicated that learners who
              received perceptual training on palatal codas outperformed those

              learning to new words and new talkers. Yet perception
              improvements were not directly linked to production improvements.
              The finding that perceptual training improved production and
              allowed for generalizability to new words and talkers in both
              perception and production provides evidence that L2 perception

              must establish mappings between familiar speech sounds and new
              phoneme categories. For example, Spanish learners of English must
              learn that [d] and [{\dh}], which are allophones of the same
              phoneme in Spanish, can distinguish meaning in English (i.e.,
              /deɪ/ ``day'' and /{\dh}eɪ/ ``they''). Because adult listeners
              are less sensitive to allophonic than phonemic contrasts in their
              native language (L1), novel target language contrasts between L1
              allophones may pose special difficulty for L2 learners. We
              investigate whether advanced Spanish late-learners of English
              overcome native language mappings to establish new phonological
              relations between familiar phones. We report behavioral and
              magnetoencepholographic (MEG) evidence from two experiments that
              measured the sensitivity and pre-attentive processing of three
              listener groups (L1 English, L1 Spanish, and advanced Spanish
              late-learners of English) to differences between three nonword
              stimulus pairs ([idi]-[i{\dh}i], [idi]-[iɾi], and

              relatedness of these sounds in the L1. Our results suggest that
              phonological relatedness influences perceived similarity, as
              evidenced by the results of the native speaker groups, but may
              not cause persistent difficulty for advanced L2 learners.

               A bilingual (or wholistic) view is then proposed. According to
               it, the bilingual is not the sum of two complete or incomplete

              internal validity of the Language Experience and Proficiency
              Questionnaire (LEAP-Q) was established on the basis of
              self-reported data from 52 multilingual adult participants. In
              Study 2, criterion-based validity was established on the basis of
              standardized language tests and self-reported measures from 50
              adult Spanish-English bilinguals. Reliability and validity of the
              questionnaire were established on healthy adults whose literacy
              levels were equivalent to that of someone with a high school
              education or higher. RESULTS: Factor analyses revealed consistent
              factors across both studies and suggested that the LEAP-Q was
              internally valid. Multiple regression and correlation analyses
              established criterion-based validity and suggested that
              self-reports were reliable indicators of language performance.
              Self-reported reading proficiency was a more accurate predictor
              of first-language performance, and self-reported speaking
              proficiency was a more accurate predictor of second-language
              performance. Although global measures of self-reported
              proficiency were generally predictive of language ability,
              deriving a precise estimate of performance on a particular task

              aspect, tense, and mood in Russian",
  author   = "Janda, Laura A and Lyashevskaya, Olga",
  abstract = "We propose the ``grammatical profile'' as a means of probing the
              aspectual behavior of verbs. A grammatical profile is the
              relative frequency distribution of the inflected forms of a word
              in a corpus. The grammatical profiles of Russian verbs provide
              data on two crucial issues: a) the overall relationship between
              perfective and imperfective verbs and b) the identification of
              verbs that characterize various intersections of aspect, tense
              and mood (TAM) with lexical classes. There is a long-standing
              debate over whether Russian aspectual ``pairs'' are formed only
              via suffixation (the Isacenko hypothesis) or whether they are
              formed via both suffixation and prefixation (the traditional
              view). We test the Isacenko hypothesis using data on the corpus
              frequency of inflected forms of verbs. We find that the behavior
              of perfective and imperfective verbs is the same regardless of
              whether the aspectual relationship is marked by prefixes or
              suffixes; our finding thus supports the traditional
              view.Introspective descriptions of Russian aspect have often
              connected the use of particular inflectional forms with certain
              uses of aspect; for example, the use of imperative forms with the
              imperfective aspect to produce expressions that are very polite.
              Grammatical profiles make it possible to identify verbs that
              behave as outliers, presenting unusually large proportions of
              usage in parts of the paradigm. This analysis both gives
              substance to and extends previous introspective descriptions by
              identifying the verbs most involved in certain TAM-category
              interactions. On a methodological level, this study contributes
              to current discussions on the use of inflected forms vs. lemmas
              in corpus studies. Newman (Aiming low in linguistics: Low-level
              generalizations in corpus-based research: National Chiao Tung
              University, 2008) finds valuable information at the level of the
              inflectional form, and Gries (forthcoming) argues that
              inflectional forms do not necessarily provide a better basis for
              analysis than lemmas. We agree with them that the appropriate
              level of granularity is determined by both the language and the
              linguistic phenomenon under analysis.",

               investigating (1) whether individual English learners of German

              vowel production, as reported in and Adank, van Hout, and Van de
              Velde (2007), should influence the perception of the L2 vowels if

               languages provides a window into the nature of the bilingual
               phonological space. For stop consonants, if early sequential
               bilinguals, whose languages differ in voice onset time (VOT)
               distinctions, produce native-like VOTs in each of their
               languages, it would imply that they have developed separate
               first and second language phones, that is, language-specific
               phonetic realisations for stop-voicing distinctions. Given the
               ambiguous phonological status of Greek voiced stops, which has
               been debated but not investigated experimentally, Greek-English
               bilinguals can offer a unique perspective on this issue. We
               first recorded the speech of Greek and Australian-English
               monolinguals to observe native VOTs in each language for /p, t,
               b, d/ in word-initial and word-medial (post-vocalic and
               post-nasal) positions. We then recorded fluent, early
               Greek-Australian-English bilinguals in either a Greek or English
               language context; all communication occurred in only one
               language. The bilinguals in the Greek context were
               indistinguishable from the Greek monolinguals, whereas the
               bilinguals in the English context matched the VOTs of the
               Australian-English monolinguals in initial position, but showed
               some modest differences from them in the phonetically more
               complex medial positions. We interpret these results as evidence
               that bilingual speakers possess phonetic categories for voiced
               versus voiceless stops that are specific to each language, but
               are influenced by positional context differently in their second
               than in their first language.",

  abstract = "A well-known asymmetry exists in the bilingual masked priming
              literature in which lexical decision is used: namely, masked
              primes in the dominant language (L1) facilitate decision times on
              targets in the less dominant language (L2), but not vice versa.
              In semantic categorization, on the other hand, priming is
              symmetrical. In Experiments 1--3 we confirm this task difference,
              finding robust masked L2--L1 translation priming in semantic
              categorization but not lexical decision. In formulating an
              account for these findings, we begin with the assumption of a
              representational asymmetry between L1 and L2 lexical semantic
              representations, such that L1 representations are richly
              populated and L2 representations are not. According to this
              representational account, L2--L1 priming does not occur in
              lexical decision because an insufficient proportion of the L1
              lexical semantic representation is activated by the L2 prime. In
              semantic categorization, we argue that the semantic information
              recruited to generate a decision is restricted by the task
              category, and that this restriction enhances the effectiveness of
              the L2 prime. In Experiments 4--6, these assumptions were tested
              in a within-language setting by pairing many-sense words (e.g.,
              ``head'') with few-sense words (e.g., ``skull''). In lexical
              decision, robust priming was obtained in the many-to-few
              direction (analogous to L1--L2), but, no priming was obtained in
              the few-to-many direction (analogous to L2--L1) using the same

              and Dutch realize cross-linguistic differences in the timing of a
              phonologically identical rise. Greek and Dutch share the same
              phonological structure in nonfinal or prenuclear rises. However,
              the rise is realized in different ways: Firstly, it is timed
              differently, with an earlier peak in Dutch than in Greek.
              Secondly, in Dutch the peak timing is influenced by the
              phonological length of the vowel of accented syllables (i.e., it
              is earlier when the vowel is long, and later when it is short),
              whereas no such influence exists in Greek. Two experiments
              compared the production of peak alignment by Dutch non-native
              speakers of Greek with that of a native Dutch and a native Greek
              control group. Evidence was found for bi-directional interference
              in four out of the five speakers who produced peak alignment
              which differed from the native control groups in both languages.
              The fifth speaker managed to produce peak alignment with
              native-like values in both the L1 and L2. These results mirror

              American English listeners identified stimuli from a beat/bit
              continuum varying in nine perceptually equal spectral and
              duration steps. English listeners relied predominantly on

              use of acoustic cues for the perception and production of vowel
              contrasts. This study investigated the use of two cues, i.e.,
              vowel spectrum and duration, for the categorization of the Dutch
              /aː/-/ɑ/ contrast in three groups of listeners: L1-Dutch,
              L1-Spanish L2-Dutch, and L1-German listeners. Three aspects of
              vowel contrast perception were tested: the categorical nature of
              the listeners' perceptual boundary, their cue weighting, and
              their use of the individual cues. Experience with the Dutch
              language played a role in the ability to perceptually distinguish
              the two vowel categories: Native Dutch listeners and Spanish
              learners of Dutch could categorize prototypical tokens of Dutch
              /aː/ and /ɑ/ more reliably than L1-German listeners without
              experience with the Dutch language. Native Dutch listeners had
              the most sharply defined boundary between the two categories. The
              results also show that language background strongly affects vowel
              perception: both L1-Dutch and L1-German listeners weight vowel
              spectrum heavier than vowel duration, whereas L1-Spanish L2-Dutch
              listeners favour vowel duration. L1-German listeners' cue
              weighting can be explained in terms of the cross-linguistic
              comparison between German and Dutch vowels. L1-Spanish L2-Dutch

              in utterance-initial position, the two-way contrast is realised
              as a contrast between unaspirated and prevoiced stops.
              Word-medially and finally, the contrast is that of voiceless,
              unaspirated stops and fully voiced stops. Fenno-Swedish is thus
              another Germanic language, like Dutch, Afrikaans and Yiddish,
              that has a contrast between plain unaspirated and prevoiced stops
              in utterance initial position. The stop contrast in Fenno-Swedish
              differs from that of Central Standard Swedish, in two ways: (i)
              In Central Standard Swedish the contrast is between aspirated and
              prevoiced stops in utterance initial position, whereas it is
              between voiceless, unaspirated stops and prevoiced stops in
              Fenno-Swedish; in medial and final position, one series of stops
              in Central Standard Swedish is voiceless (aspirated, preaspirated
              or unaspirated) and the other series is fully voiced, whereas in
              Fenno-Swedish, one series is voiceless and unaspirated and the
              other voiced, i.e., in Fenno-Swedish there is no aspiration. (ii)
              Variation was observed for some Fenno-Swedish speakers in the
              production of /b d ɡ/, with many tokens being completely
              voiceless and overlapping phonetically with tokens of /p t k/,
              whereas there is no overlap between the two stop categories in
              Central Standard Swedish. Stops in Finnish are voiceless and
              unaspirated. The fact that the aspirated stops have been lost in
              Fenno-Swedish, and the fact that there are voiceless occurrences
              of /b d ɡ/ tokens in Fenno-Swedish suggests influence from
              Finnish. Fenno-Swedish thus appears to pattern with other
              languages influenced by a language with a different system of
              laryngeal contrasts.",

              negative VOTs increase, but short-lag VOTs remain essentially
              unchanged. If we assume, as have many phonologists, that the
              two-way contrast in voicing languages (e.g. French) is [voice]
              vs. [{\O}] and in aspirating languages (e.g. English) is [spread
              glottis] vs. [{\O}], then it appears that at slower rates, a
              phonological contrast is heightened by selective increase in the
              phonetic cue for the specified feature. Thus, slowing down causes
              longer aspiration in aspirating languages and longer prevoicing
              in voicing languages but no change in short-lag stops. We report
              the results of an experiment on Central Standard Swedish stops
              designed to investigate the effect of speaking rate on VOT. CS
              Swedish uses both prevoiced and aspirated stops in
              utterance-initial position, hence the phonological feature(s)
              involved in this contrast is not clear. We found that both
              prevoicing and aspiration increase in slow speech in Swedish.
              This suggests that both [voice] and [spread glottis] are the
              specified features of phonological contrast in CS Swedish, and in
              turn raises questions about whether phonological specification
              more generally is economical. Moreover, the fact that speaking
              rate affects VOT even in situations like CS Swedish in which the
              phonological contrast is over-specified suggests that such
              modification is largely due to production dynamics, not speakers'
              sensitivity to listeners' needs.",

              voiced and voiceless Dutch plosives is generally described in
              terms of the presence or absence of prevoicing (negative voice
              onset time). Experiment 1 showed, however, that prevoicing was
              absent in 25\% of voiced plosive productions across 10 speakers.
              The production of prevoicing was influenced by place of
              articulation of the plosive, by whether the plosive occurred in a
              consonant cluster or not, and by speaker sex. Experiment 2 was a
              detailed acoustic analysis of the voicing distinction, which
              identified several acoustic correlates of voicing. Prevoicing
              appeared to be by far the best predictor. Perceptual
              classification data revealed that prevoicing was indeed the
              strongest cue that listeners use when classifying plosives as
              voiced or voiceless. In the cases where prevoicing was absent,
              other acoustic cues influenced classification, such that some of
              these tokens were still perceived as being voiced. These
              secondary cues were different for the two places of articulation.
              We discuss the paradox raised by these findings: although
              prevoicing is the most reliable cue to the voicing distinction
              for listeners, it is not reliably produced by speakers.",

              two-way stop contrast is almost always realized as a contrast
              between prevoiced stops and postaspirated ones. Word-medially and
              -finally, the contrast is that of a fully voiced stop and,
              variably, an unaspirated or preaspirated stop. The female
              speakers show a greater tendency to preaspirate than the male
              speakers, and the male speakers have a greater tendency for
              prevoicing than the females. The commonly observed k>t>p ranking

  abstract  = "This paper presents the results of an investigation of voicing
               in utterance-initial and intervocalic stops in monolingual
               Russian speakers. Prevoicing was found in over 97\% of the lenis
               stops; over 97\% of the intervocalic stops were fully voiced.
               Utterance-initial fortis stops were pronounced as voiceless
               unaspirated and had short positive VOT. Intervocalic fortis
               stops were completely voiceless except for a short voicing tail
               into closure. These results are relevant for typological studies
               of voicing. Some studies of languages with a two-way contrast
               between initial stops with prevoicing and short lag VOT have
               reported that prevoicing is less robust than what might be
               expected. These findings have been attributed to influence from
               another language without prevoicing. Our results with
               monolingual speakers of Russian support these claims. Our
               results are also relevant for the debate about the laryngeal
               feature in aspirating languages, which often have some voicing
               of intervocalic lenis stops. Such voicing has been attributed to
               passive voicing, in contrast with active voicing that occurs in
               true voice languages such as Russian. We found that the voicing
               in Russian is much more robust than the intervocalic voicing in
               aspirating languages. This difference is explained if the
               features of contrast are different in the two types of

  abstract = "Process theories have been extremely influential in the evolution
              of L2 writing instruction. Responding to purely formal views of
              writing, proponents borrowed the techniques and theories of
              cognitive psychology and L1 composition to refine the ways we
              understand and teach writing. While remaining the dominant
              pedagogical orthodoxy for over 30 years, however, process models
              have for some time found themselves under siege from more
              socially-oriented views of writing which reject their inherent
              liberal individualism. Instead, genre approaches see ways of
              writing as purposeful, socially situated responses to particular
              contexts and communities. In this paper, I discuss the importance
              of genre approaches to teaching L2 writing and how they
              complement process views by emphasising the role of language in
              written communication.",

              provides a choice of interface; users can write scripts in Python
              if they choose, while those who prefer to construct experiments
              graphically can use the new Builder interface. Here we describe
              the features that have been added over the last 10 years of its
              development. The most notable addition has been that Builder
              interface, allowing users to create studies with minimal or no
              programming, while also allowing the insertion of Python code for
              maximal flexibility. We also present some of the other new
              features, including further stimulus options, asynchronous
              time-stamped hardware polling, and better support for open
              science and reproducibility. Tens of thousands of users now
              launch PsychoPy every month, and more than 90 people have
              contributed to the code. We discuss the current state of the

  abstract = "Due to increasing ease of use and ability to quickly collect
              large samples, online behavioural research is currently booming.
              With this popularity, it is important that researchers are aware
              of who online participants are, and what devices and software
              they use to access experiments. While it is somewhat obvious that
              these factors can impact data quality, the magnitude of the
              problem remains unclear. To understand how these characteristics
              impact experiment presentation and data quality, we performed a
              battery of automated tests on a number of realistic set-ups. We
              investigated how different web-building platforms (Gorilla
              v.20190828, jsPsych v6.0.5, Lab.js v19.1.0, and
              psychoJS/PsychoPy3 v3.1.5), browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and
              Safari), and operating systems (macOS and Windows 10) impact
              display time across 30 different frame durations for each
              software combination. We then employed a robot actuator in
              realistic set-ups to measure response recording across the
              aforementioned platforms, and between different keyboard types
              (desktop and integrated laptop). Finally, we analysed data from
              over 200,000 participants on their demographics, technology, and
              software to provide context to our findings. We found that modern
              web platforms provide reasonable accuracy and precision for
              display duration and manual response time, and that no single
              platform stands out as the best in all features and conditions.
              In addition, our online participant analysis shows what equipment
              they are likely to use.",

  author   = "Pronk, Thomas and Wiers, Reinout W and Molenkamp, Bert and Murre,
              Jaap",
  abstract = "Web applications can implement procedures for studying the speed
              of mental processes (mental chronometry) and can be administered
              via web browsers on most commodity desktops, laptops,
              smartphones, and tablets. This approach to conducting mental
              chronometry offers various opportunities, such as increased
              scale, ease of data collection, and access to specific samples.
              However, validity and reliability may be threatened by less
              accurate timing than specialized software and hardware can offer.
              We examined how accurately web applications time stimuli and
              register response times (RTs) on commodity touchscreen and
              keyboard devices running a range of popular web browsers.
              Additionally, we explored the accuracy of a range of technical
              innovations for timing stimuli, presenting stimuli, and
              estimating stimulus duration. The results offer some guidelines
              as to what methods may be most accurate and what mental
              chronometry paradigms may suitably be administered via web
              applications. In controlled circumstances, as can be realized in
              a lab setting, very accurate stimulus timing and moderately
              accurate RT measurements could be achieved on both touchscreen
              and keyboard devices, though RTs were consistently overestimated.
              In uncontrolled circumstances, such as researchers may encounter
              online, stimulus presentation may be less accurate, especially
              when brief durations are requested (of up to 100 ms). Differences
              in RT overestimation between devices might not substantially
              affect the reliability with which group differences can be found,
              but they may affect reliability for individual differences. In
              the latter case, measurement via absolute RTs can be more
              affected than measurement via relative RTs (i.e., differences in
              a participant's RTs between conditions).",
