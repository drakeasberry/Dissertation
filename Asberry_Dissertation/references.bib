               Bever, 1970), and Jacques has been and still is one of the

              languages to segment speech and access the lexicon is the
              syllable. However, languages with different degrees of
              acoustic-phonetic transparency give rise to syllabic effects that
              vary in robustness. It follows from this account that speakers of
              phonologically similar languages should behave in a similar way.
              By exploiting the similarities between Spanish and Italian, the
              authors tested this prediction in Experiments 1-4. Indeed,
              Italian listeners were found to produce syllabic effects similar
              to those observed in Spanish listeners. In Experiment 5, the

              1, we found that syllabification effects are found in Catalan but

               in the case of Spanish speakers and Spanish materials, where a
               cross-over interaction of target (CV vs CVC sequences) and
               carrier types (CV- vs CVC-syllabitied words) gave evidence of a
               sensitivity to the input's syllabification; no such pattern

               English speakers and materials in either language. For English
               speakers, the consistent finding was for faster performance with
               CVC targets, regardless of the structure of the carrier word.
               Whether or not this is to be interpreted as evidence of

               shared the initial letters but not the first syllable
               (jun.tu-JU.NIO). In Experiment 2, this syllabic overlap could be
               phonological+orthographical (vi.rel-VI.RUS) or just phonological
               (bi.rel-VI.RUS). A syllable priming effect was found for CV
               words in both the phonological+orthographical and the
               phonological condition. In Experiment 3 we compared a
               ?phonological-syllable? condition (bi.rel-VI.RUS) with two
               control conditions (fi.rel-VI.RUS and vir.ga-VI.RUS). We found
               faster latencies for the phonological-syllabic condition than
               for the control conditions. These results suggest that syllabic
               effects are phonological in nature.",

               Esperanza",
  abstract  = "Background: Over the last decade Carreiras and colleages have
               assembled compelling empirical evidence that the syllable plays
               an important role in the visual recognition of polysyllabic
               words in Spanish. One of the clearest demonstrations of this is
               the syllable frequency effect: Words with high?frequency
               syllables are responded to more slowly than words with
               low?frequency syllables. Another key finding is the syllable
               congruency effect that has been obtained using the masked
               priming technique: Word recognition is facilitated by primes
               that correspond to the first syllable, relative to primes that
               contain one letter more or less than the first syllable. Aims:
               The study aimed to investigate the syllable frequency effect and
               the syllable congruency effect in Alzheimer patients, elderly
               people, and young adults. The goal was to examine whether and to
               what extent syllabic processing is preserved or deteriorates
               with age and/or this disease. If structural components of
               language are to some extent preserved in Alzheimer's disease
               (AD) patients and in elderly people, they should show the
               syllable congruency effect. If AD patients and elderly people
               have a breakdown in the ability to inhibit partially activated
               information, the syllable frequency effect may well turn out to
               be different in these two groups as compared to the young
               adults. Methods \& Procedures: Two experiments, one
               investigating the syllable frequency effect and the other the
               syllable congruency effect, were carried out with Alzheimer
               patients, elderly people, and young adults. In Experiment 1 we
               used the same materials and procedure used by Carreiras and
               Perea (2002) in their Experiment 4. In Experiment 2 we created
               new materials manipulating syllable frequency (high and low) and
               word frequency (high and low). AD patients, elderly people, and
               young controls participated in the two experiments. Outcomes \&
               Results: The results showed syllable congruency effects,
               replicating previous findings. However, syllable frequency
               effects were different for the three groups. Predictably, young
               adults responded more slowly to words with high?frequency
               syllables than to words with low?frequency syllables. In
               contrast, Alzheimer patients and elderly people responded more
               slowly to words with low?frequency syllables than to words with
               high frequency syllables. Conclusions: In the context of
               activation models that take into account a syllabic level of
               representation, the present results suggest that the syllabic
               layer is preserved but the inhibitory process of competition
               between lexical candidates is impaired in Alzheimer patients and
               in elderly people. The research reported in this article has

              attenuation in lexical access with 164 college students.
              Repetition priming effects in lexical decision tasks are stronger
              for low-frequency words than for high-frequency words. This
              frequency attenuation effect creates problems for
              frequency-ordered search models that assume a relatively stable
              frequency effect. It was posited that frequency attenuation is a
              product of the involvement of the episodic memory system in the
              lexical decision process. This hypothesis was supported by the
              demonstration of constant repetition effects for high- and
              low-frequency words when the priming stimulus was masked; the
              masking was assumed to minimize the influence of any possible
              episodic trace of the prime. It was further shown that long-term
              repetition effects were much less reliable when the S was not
              required to make a lexical decision response to the prime. When a
              response was required, the expected frequency attenuation effect
              was restored. It is concluded that normal repetition effects
              consist of 2 components: a very brief lexical effect that is
              independent of frequency and a long-term episodic effect that is
              sensitive to frequency. (32 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c)

               word recognition in the light of recent empirical evidence.
               After pointing out problems and omissions, a new model, called
               the BIA+, is proposed. Structurally, this new model extends the
               old one by adding phonological and semantic lexical
               representations to the available orthographic ones, and assigns
               a different role to the so-called language nodes. Furthermore,
               it makes a distinction between the effects of non-linguistic
               context (such as instruction and stimulus list composition) and
               linguistic context (such as the semantic and syntactic effects
               of sentence context), based on a distinction between the word
               identification system itself and a task/decision system that
               regulates control. At the end of the paper, the generalizability
               of the BIA+ model to different tasks and modalities is
               discussed.",

  abstract = "In this experiment we investigated the role of the lexical status
              (word/non-word) of the target item in the determination of
              phoneme and syllable detection times. Subjects monitored either
              the initial stop consonants (/b/, /d/, /p/) or the initial CV
              syllables (/ba/, /de/, /pi/) in bisyllabic target items
              (word/non-word) in mixed lists. The lexical status of the target
              item did not introduce significant differences for phoneme or
              syllable detection times. However, significant differences were
              found between the phoneme and syllable detection times. In
              addition, a strong correlation between the phoneme and syllable
              RTs for each item (word/non-word) was obtained. The first result
              shows that subjects can respond to both initial phonemes and
              syllables prior to lexical access. The second result suggests
              that phoneme detection is highly dependent on syllable
              identification.",

  author   = "Mehler, J and Hayes, R W",
  abstract = "An empirical account is offered of some of the constants that
              infants and adults appear to use in processing speech-like
              stimuli. From investigations carried out in recent years, it
              seems that syllable-like sequences act as minimal accessing
              devices in speech processing. Ss are aware in real time of
              syllabic structure in words and respond dif- ferently to words
              with the same initial three phonemes if the segmental one is CV/
              ... and the other CVC/.... Likewise, infants seem to be aware
              that a 'good' syllable must have at least one alternation if it
              is composed of more than one phoneme. When the segment is only
              one phoneme long, its status is necessarily somewhere between
              that of the phoneme and the syllable. An important problem that
              arises with the syllable is that it is an unlikely device for
              speech acquisition. Indeed, there are a few thousand syllables
              and the attribution of a given token to a type is far from
              obvious. Even if physical invariants for syllables in contexts
              were to be found, the task facing the child still remains one of
              sorting thousands of types from many more tokens. Issues
              concerning acquisition versus stable performance will be
              addressed to further constrain possible models. In addition, I
              try to show that even though information processing models are
              useful tools for describing synchronic sections of organisms, the
              elements that can account for development will have to be
              uncovered in neighbouring branches.",
