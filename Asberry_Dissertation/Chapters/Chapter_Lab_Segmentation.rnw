\section{Introduction}
% Letter string monitoring is different than syllable monitoring. Letter sequence monitoring can be done without understanding the concept of syllables even that is what I am underlyingly getting at with my design. Syllable monitoring on the other hand, is different because it does require partipants to be aware and knowledgeable in terms of syllables. This difference is exemplified by the way data is interpreted. Find BA in balada and baldosa are both correct responses by participants as is finding BAL in balada and baldosa. This is true because participants have successfully identified the letter sequence in the word regardless of the initial syllable structure of the (non)word in which they found it. On the other hand, finding BA in balada and BAL in baldosa in a syllable monitoring task are correct responses because the target syllable and word initial syllable structure match. However, responding to BAL in balada and BA in baldosa would be considered incorrect responses in the syllable monitoring task because they do not match. The incorrect responses would be thrown out because it would indicate that the participant did not know about the syllabification of the (non)words in which they were monitoring. The difference in both cases is viewed as a factor of reaction time differences between syllable structure of correct responses even though participants were only told to look for syllables in the latter task. 
%\ttodo[inline]{This chapter needs to be able to stand on its own with interested readers being able to back and read more in-depth in the introduction chapter.}

%The study of language has been taking place for a very long time. \ttodo{au: This first sentence seems unnecessary.} As time has gone on, the depth of knowledge and understanding has grown and fed into more nuanced lines of research. 
This chapter builds on the much of the previous focused on understanding how people understand and process language. Previous studies attempted to better understand how word segmentation processes were handled in the brain. %\ttodo{au: I think this paragraph needs to be tightened and brought into sharper focus.}
Most of the early research stemmed from an attempt to discover a minimal \emph{minimal perceptual unit} for speech segmentation. Phoneme, syllable, word, and sentence-level linguistic units were previously investigated for their roles in language processing \parencite{Foss1973-ll,Healy1976-js,McNeill1973-bo,Savin1970-oy}. Eventually, it became clear that no one single linguistic unit could serve as the minimal perceptual unit that these early researchers had hoped to discover. \ttodo{au: References needed to justify this assertion.} However, this line of research did reveal that the syllable had proved to be a logical and testable linguistic unit in studying language processing. 

Researchers shifted their focus towards the syllable’s role in speech perception. \ttodo{au: References needed to justify this assertion.} One popular line of research surrounding the syllable was word segmentation, which is the process by which a person breaks down a word into smaller units such as syllables and phonemes. \ttodo{au: References needed to justify this assertion.} Research results suggested that word segmentation was a pre-lexical process meaning it did not require access to the mental lexicon before the process started. \ttodo{au: References needed to justify this assertion.} The mental lexicon is the storehouse of language knowledge and accessing the meaning of a word requires information retrieval of the lexicon. %\ttodo{au: It's not clear what you mean by "the difference in time".}
A difference in the amount of time needed to make a decision is often used as a distinguishing marker for pre- and post-lexical processes. Pre-lexical processes occur much earlier in the processing timeline than post-lexical ones resulting in faster pre-lexical decisions being made \parencite{Carreiras2005-us}. %\ttodo{au: References needed to justify this assertion.} 
Since word segmentation is thought to be pre-lexical, it can be completed quickly and without attaching meaning to sound or letter sequences. \ttodo{au: References needed to justify this assertion.} It is important to note that simply being a pre-lexical process does not imply that it prohibits participants from accessing the lexicon prior to making decisions. In some cases, researchers have purposefully attempted to force participants to make contact with the mental lexicon before submitting responses in word segmentation experiments \parencite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd}. The next section of this chapter begins with an introduction to the background necessary to understand the scope and process of the experimental design.


\section{Background}
\label{lab-seg-background}
Most of the early studies focusing on the syllable in language processing involved French and English monolingual speakers \parencite{Cutler1986-zl,Mehler1981-vi}. These studies used a monitoring paradigm where participants were given a target, presented as a sound sequence or letter string, to search for in auditory word list stimuli. For example, \textcite{Mehler1981-vi} asked French subjects in a French monitoring experiment to find written CV or CVC targets, consonant-vowel or consonant-vowel-consonant, in auditory bisyllabic word lists. When participants identified the target in the auditory stimuli, they pressed a response key which allowed researchers to calculate reaction time between onset of the word and the response. In the early 90s, bilingual French--English speakers were studied under the same paradigm \parencite{Cutler1992-qq}. Finally, around the same time, Spanish speakers were studied for the first time \parencite{Bradley1993-qq,Sebastian-Galles1992-xd}. The monitoring paradigm proved to serve fruitful in testing the syllable’s role in speech processing. As a result, the monitoring experimental task is again used in the current project. However, the presentation of all targets and experimental stimuli was presented visually rather than auditorily. This allows the current study to rule out phonetic effects created such co-articulation in the stimuli recordings. Utilizing a completely visual presentation ensures that the phonology activated by the participant reading the target and the stimuli is consistent within each participant.

During the monitoring paradigm, syllables were never mentioned to the participants even though the CV and CVC targets were syllable sized. %\ttodo{au: Unclear what is meant here, since a paradigm can't really mention anything.} 
This allowed researchers to compare CV and CVC targets to the word or nonword initial syllable of the word in which participants were expected to find the target. These previous findings reported most of their findings in terms of whether or not a crossover effect was found or not. \ttodo{au: References needed to justify this assertion.}Understanding what is meant by the crossover effect is paramount to understanding the results found in previous literature and interpreting the results of the current study. In previous literature, researchers interpreted their results by the target syllable structure and word-initial syllable structure as a factor of reaction time. The target for which participants monitored was a factor containing two levels---CV and CVC. The second factor was the word-initial syllable structure of the presented word, which also had two levels of CV and CVC. The crossover effect was interpreted as the favorable conditions that produced faster reaction times for matching conditions. For example, if a syllabic segmentation strategy is being used, then monitoring for a CV sequence should be detected faster when the presented word has a CV word-initial syllable when compared to a presented word that has a CVC word-initial syllable. Likewise, monitoring for a CVC sequence should be found faster when the word containing the target begins with a CVC word-initial syllable rather than a CV one. In other words, monitoring for a sound or letter sequence that matches the initial syllable structure of the word containing it makes it an easier task. The easier task is marked by the faster reaction times needed to indicate the syllable had been detected. The results of statistical analysis indicated the crossover effect was present with a significant interaction between the search target structure and the word-initial syllable structure containing the target. When plotted, the data is visualized as two intersecting lines which represented the significant interaction between the two factors. Figure \ref{plt-sample-crossover} shows an example of simulated data to illustrate the visualization of a significant crossover effect.\ttodo{mh: Dupoux and I did a bunch of these with the hypothesis that stress-based syllabification was the cause of the English non-effect. We got some sporadic effects by controlling for stress, but nothing conclusive unfortunately. au: This paragraph needs to be more clear. Including some specific examples might help.}

Up to this point, the syllabic-based segmentation strategy had revolved around French and English monolingual data. The results supported a language specific process as French speakers seemed to employ this strategy, but English speakers did not. In addition, \textcite{Cutler1992-qq} had tested French--English bilinguals using the same experimental items from \textcite{Mehler1981-vi, Cutler1986-zl}, but found that the effect had seemed to disappear. \textcite{Cutler1992-qq} ran some post-hoc analysis to split groups according to language dominance. They found that French dominant participants utilized the syllable segmentation with French words and inhibited this process with English words. Their English dominant participants showed no syllable segmentation strategy with English or French words. The important finding revealed that bilinguals were not the summation of two individual monolinguals, which means that a bilingual group should not be expected to behave the same as their monolingual counterparts. Understanding these findings, the current project follows a similar setup by comparing L1 Spanish--L2 English bilinguals against L1 English--L2 Spanish bilinguals. This design differs from previous research that had compared monolingual speakers of Spanish and monolingual speakers of English to Spanish--English bilinguals. It also drove selection criteria for the population of speakers that were recruited and included in the analysis by planning for language dominance. Recruitment in the US aligned with English as their L1 and dominant language while recruitment in Mexico aligned Spanish as their L1 and dominant language. In both cases, participants were second language learners of the other language rather than the simultaneous French--English bilinguals who had learned both languages from infancy. 

While this monitoring paradigm research was founded primarily in French and English, it also has been previously extended to other language populations as well. \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} investigated Catalan--Spanish bilingual speakers by continuing with the monitoring paradigm and expanding it to languages not yet studied, specifically Spanish and Catalan. The researchers conducted a series of three experiments all within the monitoring paradigm using CV and CVC structures for target items that could match or mismatch the CV or CVC syllable structure word-initially. \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} noted that French stress was fixed and always fell on the last syllable of the word, but in English stress was variable. The authors argued that Spanish and Catalan were prime candidates to study the issue of stress because it overcame the experimental design flaws of French and English studies \parencite{Mehler1981-vi, Cutler1986-zl, Cutler1992-qq}. To illustrate their claim, \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} argued that since Spanish and Catalan both had variable word stress, a direct comparison between the two languages could be made while controlling for stress. They utilized 5 quadruplet sets for Spanish and 5 quadruplet sets for Catalan. In each quadruplet set, two of the words began with CV syllables and two began with CVC syllables. Additionally, two of the words were stressed word-initially while the other two were unstressed in the word initial syllable.

In the first experiment, Catalan-dominant speakers who had also learned Spanish during their school age years were monitoring for the CV or CVC sound sequences in 5 quadruplet word sets of Catalan. Their results for Catalan revealed a syllabic segmentation strategy as evidenced by the crossover effect caused by the interaction of the syllable structure of the target and the syllable structure of the presented word. However, they only found the crossover effect when the initial syllable of the presented word was unstressed. When the initial syllable was stressed the interaction was no longer significant and the crossover effect was not obtained. This suggested that Catalan speakers utilized a syllable segmentation strategy with unstressed word-initial syllables, but not with stressed word-initial syllables. This presented a third implementation of syllabic segmentation to consider, which had not been previously discussed. This provided evidence that the syllable segmentation strategy may not be used universally even within a single language, but instead, language users could use it all the time, none of the time or some of the time. Monolingual French speakers represent a group that uses it all the time even when language input would not seemingly make it advantageous to do so while monolingual English speakers never employed a syllabic segmentation strategy even when the language input would promote it \parencite{Mehler1981-vi, Cutler1986-zl}. The participants in \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} exemplify the third option where it is employed in unstressed condition, but not the stressed one. The other important implication of these results was that it was possible to find evidence of a syllabic segmentation strategy in language with variable stress and vowel reduction, both of which are present in the English language.\ttodo{yeah, but there's no evidence that Catalan has stress-sensitive syllabification like English, right?} The \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} study also informed the current study in terms of experimental design. While they utilized a mixed design utilizing word-initially stressed and unstressed words in the same the design, the current study controlled for stress by only including items with penultimate word stress.

In a second experiment of the \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} study, the same procedure was followed as their first experiment except the participants were L1 Spanish speakers monitoring for sound sequences in Spanish. The vowel in the initial word syllable was controlled for by using only the vowel /a/. This allowed the results of experiment number 2 to be comparable with \textcite{Mehler1981-vi}. The results of the second experiment by \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} showed no significant interactions between the target syllable structure and syllable structure of the word-initial syllable. Unlike the results in Catalan, the lack of interaction held for both word initial stressed and unstressed syllables. The importance of this finding lied in the information it gave to hypotheses and explanations of previous findings. 

Firstly, it stood against the hypothesis formed by \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} based on their own findings in their first experiment with Catalan. They stated that stimuli with unstressed syllables should have a larger effect of syllabic strategy than stressed ones due to being less transparent. However, words that had initial stress made it easier for participants to detect sound sequences as revealed through faster times than words with initially unstressed syllables. This was in line with unstressed syllables being less transparent and thus taking more time to be accurately recognized. It also went against the earlier finding, which did find a syllabic effect in Spanish, but they only tested unstressed word-initial syllables \parencite[Sánchez-Casas, 1988 as cited in][]{Bradley1993-qq}. This finding by \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} provided evidence against \textcite{Cutler1983-dn, Cutler1986-zl}, which had argued for ambisyllabicity in English as a cause to disregard the syllabic strategy due to its ineffectiveness for processing English. \textcite{Cutler1983-dn, Cutler1986-zl} argued that since French had clear syllable boundaries, i.e. the absence of ambisyllabicity, French speakers incorporated a syllabic processing strategy. Spanish, like French, does not contain ambisyllabic words giving way to very clear and well defined syllable boundaries. Nonetheless, these Spanish speakers were unable to utilize the syllabic strategy to process Spanish.

Finally, \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} tested a last hypothesis that the syllabic strategy may have been used, but experimental demands may cause participants to respond at different stages of processing. They noted the difference between mean reaction times in their own experiment 2, 376 ms, and those found in Sánchez-Casas (1988) that averaged 636 ms. While Sánchez-Casas (1988) used catch trials that used the same phoneme, \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} did not, which they hypothesize that may have allowed participants to make decisions based on subsyllabic information. Due to the differences in experimental designs, \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} attempted to slow down participants where reactions times were more comparable to those found by Sánchez-Casas (1988). In experiment 3, \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} reran experiment 2 with one additional task. They asked participants to pay attention to the semantic relationship between words which had been shown to slow participants down by as much as 200 ms \parencite[Dupoux, 1989 as cited in][]{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd}. As a result of slowing down participant responses by nearly 250 ms, \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} found a significant interaction between target and word type for words that are initially unstressed, but the same interaction was not significant for word stressed on the initial syllable. These results are similar to those found in Catalan from experiment 1 and Sánchez-Casas (1988) unstressed word-initial syllables in Spanish. These results became important considerations because the experimental demands were shown to be the distinguishing factor in finding the interaction between target and word structures or not. These findings collectively revealed that experimental conditions can play a role in the syllabic segmentation effect being found. Extremely fast reaction times seemed to have masked this effect that was available when monitoring in Spanish because the effect with the same stimuli appeared when participants were forced to slow down.

A second crucial previous study was \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} which investigated Spanish monolinguals, English monolinguals and Spanish--English bilinguals. The first four experiments fell under the monitoring paradigm and extended the French and English findings by \textcite{Cutler1986-zl} to Spanish and English. In the first experiment, Spanish monolinguals monitored for CV and CVC targets in Spanish words while participants from the same Spanish speaking population performed the same task with English words in the fourth experiment. The second experiment had monolingual English speakers monitor for CV and CVC targets in English words while the third experiment had English speakers from the same population monitoring for CV and CVC targets in Spanish words. Finally, the fifth experiment extended the paradigm to Spanish--English bilinguals who were late learners of English---generally after puberty \parencite{Bradley1993-qq}. This fifth experiment was replicating the French--English bilinguals studied by \textcite{Cutler1992-qq}.

For the Spanish materials, \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} increased the variation used in consonantal phonemes of targets. Previous literature in French used initial voiced or voiceless plosives /p, b, t, d, k, g/ as the onset, the vowel /a/ as the nucleus. For previous French CVC targets, a liquid /l, \textturnr/ was used in the coda position \parencite{Mehler1981-vi}. \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} utilized plosives, but also expanded options to fricatives, liquids and nasals in the onset position. They also expanded the vowel options to any of the five Spanish monophthongs /a, e, i, o, u/ as the nucleus. While they used liquids as in previous studies, they also included nasals /n, m/ and the fricative /s/ in the coda position for their Spanish materials. This added variation of phonemes in the target syllable allowed them to create 24 word pairs, which were trisyllabic nouns stressed on the penultimate syllable. In these word-initially unstressed Spanish words, the first three phonemes were always the same, but they differed in syllable structure.\ttodo{there's a whole related literature on overt syllabification that uses these. Treiman did the most important experimental work. I have some things on the phonology side of the house.} For example, the word pair \emph{pa.lo.ma-pal.me.ra} share the initial three phonemes /pal/; however, the syllable boundaries marked with periods show different syllable structures. The first syllable of \emph{paloma} 'pigeon' has a structure of CV while the initial syllable of \emph{palmera} 'palm tree' is a CVC syllable. 

A second set of experimental words was created for English and followed as closely as possible the construction of Spanish materials by matching the CVC of the English and Spanish words. For example, the Spanish pairing \emph{paloma-palmera} was matched to the English pairing \emph{palace-palpitate}. Again 24 word pairs were created where the first three phonemes were the same, but the words differed in their word-initial syllable structure. One important difference to note is that the English materials had word-initial stress followed by an unstressed second syllable and words ranged from 2-4 syllables in length.\ttodo{Could this have had an effect? This most likely had some effect, but no determination of how it affected the results have been shown to my knowledge. Saved for later thought. Mike: the first syllable should then be closed in all cases.} 
This differs from their Spanish material which were all three syllables in length and unstressed word-initially. The stress of the placement of the word has been shown to mask the syllabic strategy \parencite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd}. In \textcite{Cutler1986-zl}, the onset of English items was limited to plosives and the nasal /m/, the nucleus was controlled for the vowel /\ae/. For CVC initially-syllabified words, the coda was a liquid /l, \textturnr/ \parencite{Cutler1986-zl}. Similar to their Spanish materials, \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} used plosives, but expanded the options for their English materials to fricatives, nasals and liquids for onsets, the nucleus was controlled for with vowels /\ae, e, I, \textopeno/ and the coda position was limited to the liquid /l/, nasals /n, m/ and the fricative /s/. The liquid /\textturnr/ was not used because it is not available in the coda position without altering the vowel quality in Australian English.\ttodo{in American as well.}

Similar to previous monitoring studies, monolingual Spanish speakers monitored for CV and CVC syllables in Spanish. However, the targets were presented auditorily rather than visually resulting in a completely auditory experimental design. The results of the study showed the crossover effect through the significant interaction between the structure of target and the word initial syllable containing it. The advantage of finding the CV targets in words with CV word initial structure and CVC targets in words with CVC initial syllables extended the French results from \textcite{Mehler1981-vi} to Spanish. The major difference in the result was the average reaction time with an average addition of 200 ms in the Spanish study. The French study showed average response times between 352 ms and 378 ms while the Spanish study averaged response times between 556 ms and 609 ms. \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} argued that auditory target presentation was not the reason for the increased reaction time citing the pilot study they conducted with visual target presentation as evidence showing even slower response times with visually presented targets. They argued that their slower response times could have been to the added complexity of syllable variation in comparison to the French study, which was much more restrictive in the phonemes that constructed experimental items. Although, not mentioned by \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}, both studies omitted about three percent of their data given arbitrary response time cut-offs. The French study omitted all response outside of 100 ms and 1000 ms while the Spanish study omitted all responses below 200 ms and above 2000 ms \parencite{Bradley1993-qq,Mehler1981-vi}. \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} also used this pilot study to claim an increase in syllabic effect size found in experiment 1 as a result of moving from visual to auditory target presentation. Following the methodology set forth by \textcite{Cutler1986-zl}, \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} used the same Spanish materials they created and tested monolingual English speakers. The only difference in procedure was that participants received the target presentation both visually and auditorily. The L1 English speakers listening to Spanish continued to show no interaction between target structure and the word-initial syllable structure. In other words, English speakers seemed to not apply a syllabic segmentation strategy even though the monitored language, Spanish, encouraged the use of it. The Spanish group results indicated that the lack of the effect in English speakers was not due to the experimental items, but something fundamentally different about the segmentation strategies. This is inline with findings of the English speakers tested in French who also did not show the ability to employ the syllabic segmentation strategy \parencite{Cutler1986-zl}. These findings provided more support of language specific strategies in regards to segmentation and the fact that speakers have transferred it to their processing toolkit when attempting to parse an unfamiliar language.

As in previous studies on monitoring, monolingual English speakers were tasked with monitoring for CV and CVC sound or letter sequences in the English materials. Again, \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} presented the targets auditorily rather than visually. As before, they also reran the experiment with a different group recruited from the same speaker population with the auditory and visual target presentation to show that this presentational difference did not cause the effects in their results as compared to those found by \textcite{Cutler1986-zl}. In contrast to the Spanish monitoring in experiment 1, but not unlike the English monitoring by \textcite{Cutler1986-zl}, there was no crossover effect found with the English speakers monitoring English words. Continuing in the vein of replicating the French and English findings of \textcite{Cutler1986-zl}, \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} tested L1 Spanish speakers with the English material they had created. Similar to the naive monitoring of Spanish, a procedural change included showing the English target to monolingual Spanish speakers in addition to the auditory presentation. The results revealed no crossover effect as evidenced by the absence of interaction between target structure and word-initial syllable structure with the English data being monitored by Spanish speakers. This finding was interesting because French and Spanish are both romance languages, are both considered to be syllable timed and neither have ambisyllabicity. However, the transference of a syllabic segmentation strategy from French to English in \textcite{Cutler1986-zl} does not seem to hold true for Spanish speakers.

In summary of their four experiments that were replicating the French and English study by \textcite{Cutler1986-zl}, the results of \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} were valuable. In the Spanish material, there was no tendency for the CV targets to be found faster and the CVC targets or vice versa by Spanish speakers. However, there was an advantage of the CVC targets being found faster than CV targets by English speakers. For English speakers, this advantage for CVC targets over the CV targets held true in English material as well, but Spanish speakers did not show this same advantage in English materials. Thus, a conclusion of syllable preference for CVC structures over CV structure could not be upheld. It also brought out the fact that other items may be at play with regards to syllabic segmentation strategies give that French speakers transferred the strategy to English, but Spanish speakers did not given the absence of an interaction in their data.

Lastly, an addition to the literature for \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} came in their fifth experiment where they changed their participants to a Spanish-English bilingual group. The participants in this group were native Castillian Spanish speakers who had learned English as a second language. All of their participants had lived in an English speaking region for a minimum of three years with an average of 18 years and resided in an English speaking country at the time of data collection. These participants completed the Spanish monitoring experiment following the same exact procedures that the monolingual Spanish speakers followed. Surprisingly, these Spanish-English bilinguals showed no effects of a syllabic strategy even when monitoring in their native language. The only significant finding was the faster detection response times to words with CV initial syllables over CVC initial ones. The researchers again reran the study with different speakers from the same population with visual target presentations only to rule out the difference between target presentation modality and the effects it could have on results. Not only did it rule out the potential effect of target presentation, but made results more comparable to previous studies \parencite{Mehler1981-vi, Cutler1986-zl}. \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} took it one step further and tested a group of Uruguayan Spanish-English bilinguals living in Australia at the time. All speakers of the Uruguayan dialect had learned English post puberty when they emigrated to Australia. The results in all three groups did not ever show a significant interaction between the target structure and the word-initial syllable structure containing the target. The most interesting finding of experiment 5 was the fact that native Spanish-speaker data for syllabic segmentation appeared to be a productive strategy. However upon becoming bilingual with the acquisition of English as a second language, the childhood native language segmentation strategy appeared to have been abandoned even when processing the first language---Spanish. While it was not possible to determine exactly how much exposure or proficiency is needed in the second language to cause the abandonment of a native segmentation strategy, it appeared to be less than 3 years of residency in the second language environment according to \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}. 

The combined results of the five experiments in \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} informed the current study in several ways. The first is that the experimental items used are not likely causing the effect to be found or masked. It successfully replicated previous French--English studies with success even though the results suggested the topic is more complicated than romance language families versus non-romance language families or clear syllable boundaries versus ambisyllabicity. It did alter the design to include in auditory target presentation for native speakers and the bilingual group, which had not been previously done before. They were successful at replicating the effect in monolinguals using these auditory target--auditory stimuli design in monolingual groups, but not the effect disappeared with bilingual group. 


\section{Present Study}
%Due to previous findings in Spanish being less than convincing, a small pilot study was completed in the summer of 2018. One PsychoPy experiment that included two separate tasks---a visual letter sequence monitoring task and a syllabification task---was designed and conducted completely in Spanish. Eight native speakers of Spanish who had attended school in a Spanish speaking country and learned English as adults were recruited from the University of Arizona main campus in Tucson, Arizona. All participants were highly proficient in their L2 English as they were currently enrolled in or had just recently completed their graduate degree at the University of Arizona. The results of direct elicitation of initial syllable structure showed a consistent syllabification pattern between participants. Six of the eight participants responded to all items correctly while the remaining two participants responded incorrectly to only one item in the task.

%For the letter sequence monitoring task, one of the participants was removed from the analysis for having an error rate of more than 10 percent in responses to critical items. However, the data for the remaining seven participants were submitted to a (2) x (2) anova. There were no significant main effect of target or carrier type, p > 0.05, but they still showed a significant interaction between the visually presented targets and carrier items in the monitoring task. Participants responded faster when the target syllable structure matched the initial syllable structure of carrier item than when they did not coincide. This interaction was driven by the fact that CVC syllable were responded to faster when the word began with CVC syllable,

%These results indicated that it was possible to see evidence of the syllabic segmentation strategy in a L1 Spanish, L2 English bilingual group and that this effect could be captured through a completely visual word segmentation design.

Utilizing the progression of historical studies, the letter sequence monitoring task was chosen to investigate the use of syllabic segmentation strategies in bilingual speakers of English and Spanish. %\ttodo{au: This wording is awkward.} 
The previous findings in Spanish had been less than convincing. The syllabic segmentation strategy had been found in Spanish for some conditions, but not others. Therefore, this study first sought to replicate the Spanish--English bilingual findings in \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} utilizing a visual rather than auditory experimental design. They argued that this changing the target presentation to auditory format simply aided the participant in forming what previous studies assumed the participant formed for target phonological representations. While it proved to be a successful tactic, it potentially introduced a confound into the design, which stems from the phonetic properties due to co-articulation of adjacent segments. This can be illustrated with with the words \emph{ba-lón} 'ball' and \emph{bal-cón} 'balcony'. The [l] in \emph{balón} is different from the [l] in \emph{balcón} although both map to the single phoneme /l/. Rather than allowing participants to formulate their own phonological representations of the targets, they were given this additional phonetic detail, which could aide in the monitoring task and would not have been given in a visual only target presentation. Therefore, finding \emph{ba} in \emph{ba-lón} should be faster than in \emph{bal-cón} and finding \emph{bal} in \emph{bal-cón} should be faster than in \emph{ba-lón}. This faster detection time for matching conditions may not only be because of the syllable structure, but also because the phonetic level details between target and word match.

In order to control for the phonetic detail confound with syllable structure in \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}, one possibility would be to use auditory cross-splicing so that target and word-initial syllable would have differing phonetic properties. Even utilizing a cross-splicing method has the potential to introduce phonetic detail that could affect results in a helpful or hurtful manner that would be difficult to tease apart. Therefore, the current study design uses a visual target-visual word presentation, which completely eliminates any possibility for inhibitory or facilitatory effects of phonetic detail.%\ttodo{another possibility would be some sort of auditory cross-splicing....}
This gives participants the ability to form their own phonological representations of the targets as had been done previously \parencite{Mehler1981-vi, Cutler1986-zl,Cutler1992-qq,Sebastian-Galles1992-xd}. Unlike previous studies, participants are required to form their own phonological representations for the visual stimuli they are reading when searching for the target as well. A visual design has two distinct advantages in the current study. The first is that it removes any and all potential confounds that could arise from the phonetic detail unknowingly processed by the participants in the target or experimental stimuli. \ttodo{au: This seems repetitive.} Secondly, both and the target and experimental words are processed utilizing the same phonological system, which is contained within the mind of the participant. This differs from the auditory design where experimental items are read and recorded by someone. Misalignment between the speaker and a participant's own perceptions or productions could affect results due to individual differences that naturally exist between speakers of a language. These differences are likely to be larger for L2 learners listening to a native speaker recording than for other listeners who share the native language of the recorder. 

This visual design can only be useful if it is understood that visual input is filtered through the phonology. In other words, a visual design assumes that phonology is activated through the process of reading. There is empirical research that supports reading as an activity that activates phonological representations in the mind of the reader. \textcite{Haigh2007-mt} tested bilinguals with interlingual homophones when silently reading. Bilinguals activated both L1 and L2 phonological systems when reading in their L2, but not in their L1. Many previous visual word recognition studies have taken advantage of this reading--phonology link. Like the current study, previous word recognition studies did not require reading sentences or paragraphs. However, participants had to read the stimuli presented on the screen in order to complete a task, where individual words appeared in sequential order. \textcite{Carreiras2002-mp} investigated syllable congruency as a means of measuring the facilitation or inhibition in the lexical access of Spanish. They found the a crossover effect using six letter disyllabic Spanish words ---CV.CV.CV or CVC.CVC in syllabic structure. \textcite{Alvarez2004-nd} utilized clear and unambiguous phoneme–grapheme correspondence where several graphemes map onto the same phoneme as in 'b' and 'v' in Spanish. This allowed them to disentangle the orthographic syllable from the phonological syllable where their results supported the activation of phonological representations during the visual word recognition experiments. \textcite{Pollatsek2005-fn} found comparable effects for the phonological syllable priming in a lexical decision experiment by manipulating the vowel of the initial syllable, which caused the letter 'c' to change from /k/ to /\texttheta/ in Spanish. Similar results were found in French visual segmentation experiment finding that the segmentation of written syllabifications aligned with the phonological syllabifications \parencite{Chetail2013-er}. Other studies have measured brain activity in response to visual stimuli where support for the phonological syllable in word segmentation and lexical access was found \parencite{Carreiras2005-us,Carreiras2008-ar}.

All of the bilinguals tested by \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} were those who had immigrated to a English speaking country and had resided there for a minimum of three years. \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} argued that this predominant L2 environment may have caused the crossover effect to be masked as a possible explanation to why their L1 Spanish--L2 English bilingual participants seemed to have abandoned the syllable segmentation strategy. Unlike \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}, the current study utilized L1 Spanish speakers who had learned English as a second language, but continued to reside in their home countries as the control group. If indeed the reason for the lack of the crossover effect found in \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} was due to residing in an English-speaking environment, albeit their second language environment, testing a different group with similar characteristics living in their first language environment may result in evidence for the syllabic segmentation strategy being used in Spanish. If however, the Spanish--English bilinguals continuing to live in their L1 environment fail to reveal any indication that the syllabic strategy is being used to segment Spanish, it could be argued that the experience and exposure of the L2 from living abroad was not the reason these native Spanish speakers abandoned an efficient segmentation strategy from their L1. The control group for this study provided a good comparison to the bilingual group from \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} because while they shared similar language backgrounds, they differed in their current living environments at the time the experiments were conducted.

In addition to running a replication of \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}, the main goal of this study was to extend the investigation to second language learners of Spanish who were L1 speakers of English. This target group demographic had yet to be tested up to this point to see whether or not a syllabic segmentation strategy could be learned and utilized after acquiring a language that supports it. Up to this point French--English bilingual had been tested and all results had pointed to an English stress-based segmentation strategy \parencite{Cutler1992-qq}. \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} had successfully shown that monolingual Spanish speakers utilized the syllable-based segmentation strategy, but the L1 Spanish--L2 English bilinguals did not exhibit the same behavior. If the learning of English was able to affect Spanish and French speakers segmentation strategies, it is theoretically possible that the learning of Spanish as a second language could also have an effect on L1 English speakers' segmentation strategies. %\ttodo{remember the argument for doing this cannot simply be that it hasn't yet been done. You have to argue that testing on this population addresses some key theoretical and/or empirical question.} 
There were two possible outcomes for the L1 English group. If the group of English--Spanish bilinguals showed evidence of segmenting syllabically when processing Spanish, it would support the learning of a new strategy which had consistently been shown not to be productive in their L1 English. If this were the case, then it would beg the question as to whether or not training second language learners of Spanish in syllable-based segmentation could be a productive learning tool for online processing. %\ttodo{say why that's interesting....}
On the other hand, if they did not exhibit the use of segmenting Spanish syllabically, it would support previous findings that had shown L1 English speakers do not segment language syllabically even when the language structure promotes its efficacy. This would strengthen the argument for a non-syllabic segmentation strategy in English speakers because unlike the previous studies, the participants in this study were also intermediate to advanced Spanish language learners---i.e. not näive Spanish listeners.


\section{Methods}
In order to address these questions and possible outcomes, a visual letter sequence monitoring task was conducted to analyze the word segmentation strategies used by the participants. During the monitoring experiment, participants were shown a two or three letter string that represented a CV or CVC syllable. They were instructed to respond as quickly as possible when they had found the matching letter string in the individually presented words. Both the letter stings, i.e. targets, and the words were presented visually. This is the first study that has tested this segmentation strategy in a completely visual manner using a letter sequence monitoring task. Running the experiment in this manner came with one major assumption. This design assumed that participants were actually activating the phonological representation of the sounds of the target, i.e. syllable, and the word they read on the screen. For a full discussion on this topic, refer to Chapter \ref{ch-intro} Section \ref{sec-phon-activation}.

\subsection{Participants}
All participants reported in this chapter were recruited for experiments that took place in an in-person laboratory setting. In this study, L1 Spanish speakers who were second language learners of English were used as the control group. The target group consisted of L1 English speakers who were second language learners of Spanish. All participants recruited continued to live in their L1 environment, or birth country, at the time of data collection. There were \Sexpr{lab_stat_compare["Spanish", "n"]} participants in L1 Spanish group recruited from the University of Sonora in Hermosillo, Mexico and \Sexpr{lab_stat_compare["English", "n"]} participants in L1 English group recruited from the University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ. In total, \Sexpr{lab_stat_compare["English", "n"] + lab_stat_compare["Spanish", "n"]} participants completed the experiment. For a full description of each group see Chapter \ref{ch-sampling} Section \ref{sec-participants}.

Additional data collected through the LexTALE, LexTALE-Esp and the Bilingual Language Profile (BLP) tasks completed during the same session as the letter sequence monitoring task were used to ensure that participants actually represented the intended group for which they were recruited \parencite{Birdsong2012-wd,Izura2014-yw,Lemhofer2012-hz}. Using responses to the BLP, \Sexpr{lab_part_removal_sum["fluency-English", "n"] + lab_part_removal_sum["location-Spanish", "n"] + lab_part_removal_sum["dominance-English", "n"] + lab_part_removal_sum["dominance-Spanish", "n"]} were removed because they did not accurately represent the groups for which they had been recruited. \Sexpr{lab_part_removal_sum["fluency-English", "n"]} L1 English speaker was removed because they reported fluency in languages other than Spanish and English. \Sexpr{lab_part_removal_sum["location-Spanish", "n"]} L1 Spanish speakers were removed because they reported being born and/or raised outside of Mexico. \Sexpr{lab_part_removal_sum["dominance-English", "n"] + lab_part_removal_sum["dominance-Spanish", "n"]} participants were removed because they were outliers in terms of language dominance scores calculated by the BLP. Lastly, using the scores from both the LexTALE and LexTALE-Esp, \Sexpr{lab_part_removal_sum["vocabulary-Spanish", "n"]} L1 Spanish speakers were removed because their scores indicated a larger L2 English vocabulary size than their L1 Spanish vocabulary size.

Once the demographic removals had been completed, an accuracy response rate for the experiment was conducted on the remaining \Sexpr{lab_completed_eligible_sum["English", "n"] + lab_completed_eligible_sum["Spanish", "n"]} participants. A predetermined accuracy rate of 90 percent was used as the cut-off and any participant responding incorrectly to filler or critical trials more than 10 percent of the time was removed from the analysis. All participants correctly responded to filler trials above the cut-off point; however, \Sexpr{length(lab_error_removal$partNum)} participant was removed for committing errors at rate greater than 10 percent to critical trials. After the removal of participants, \Sexpr{lab_stat_compare["English", "n"] - lab_analyzed_sum["English", "n"]} participants from the L1 English group and \Sexpr{lab_stat_compare["Spanish", "n"] - lab_analyzed_sum["Spanish", "n"]} participants from the L1 Spanish group were removed. This left a total of \Sexpr{lab_analyzed_sum["English", "n"] + lab_analyzed_sum["Spanish", "n"]} participants---\Sexpr{lab_analyzed_sum["English", "n"]} L1 English speakers and \Sexpr{lab_analyzed_sum["Spanish", "n"]} L1 Spanish speakers, that had data submitted to the analysis and only these participants are included in reported statistics and figures below. Table \ref{tab-lab-demo-part} gives age related data about participants, Table \ref{tab-lab-vocab-part} give data related to participant vocabulary sizes and Table \ref{tab-lab-lang-blp-part} shows language scores collected through the BLP.


\subsection{Materials \& Design}
There were 24 real word pairs and 24 nonword pairs selected as critical items where the initial syllable structure varied between a CV and a CVC structure while the first three phonemes were shared between the two. Words are a logical choice for testing segmentation strategies because they mimic what language user do everyday. However, the study also includes nonwords because if the same evidence for syllable-based segmentation is found in nonwords, it would suggest that segmentation processes are separate from lexical access processes. In addition, it would suggest that are part of the phonological system and structures of the language. In this case, participants are simply applying the rules of their language processing systems to nonwords that follow phonotactic constraints---i.e. could potentially be real words of the language. %\ttodo{why include nonwords?} 
Example real word pairs included: \emph{ba.la.da--bal.do.sa} 'ballad--floor tile', \emph{cu.le.bra--cul.pa.ble} 'snake--culprit', \emph{mo.re.ra--mor.ci.llo} 'mulberry--beef shank' and \emph{jo.ro.ba--jor.na.da} 'hump--day'. A majority of the real word stimuli came from \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}, but two additional word pairs were created---\emph{ga.nan.cia--gan.chi.llo} 'profit--crochet' and \emph{pa.sa.je--pas.ti.lla} 'passage--pill'---in order to obtain the 24 word pairs. Five other words, \emph{casino, censura, cultura, mortero} and \emph{perfume}, were also replaced to avoid potential cognate effects with \emph{casilla, centavo, culpable, morcillo} and \emph{permiso} respectively. Example nonword pairs included: \emph{ba.le.ga--bal.bu.sa, cu.li.tra--cul.se.ble, mo.ri.pa--mor.bo.llo,} and \emph{jo.ru.ma--jor.te.da}. In addition to the 24 critical real word pairs, another 294 real Spanish words were selected to use as fillers and are also balanced according to initial syllable structure---147 start with a CV syllable and 147 start with a CVC syllable. Likewise, in addition to the 24 critical nonword pairs, 294 nonwords were selected and counterbalanced for initial syllable structure. All critical items and fillers were trisyllabic and stressed on the penultimate syllable. In order to create the nonwords, the 48 real Spanish words were submitted to a nonword generator called Wuggy \parencite{Keuleers2010-vq}. Wuggy is a program that allows for nonword creation while adhering to standard orthographic rules of a language. See Appendix \ref{app-wuggy}) for all instructions and parameters used in creating the nonwords used in this experiment. For a complete list of experimental items used in the current chapter, see Appendix \ref{segmentation-stimuli}.

The experiment was run completely in Spanish and there were four different versions. The four versions of the experiment were necessary for counter-balancing purposes, which was accomplished by balancing across participants. In order to illustrate with an the example word-pair \emph{balada–baldosa}, participants in condition 1 searched for \emph{BA} in \emph{balada}, participants in condition 2 searched for \emph{BAL} in \emph{balada}, participants in condition 3 searched for \emph{BA} in \emph{baldosa} and participants in condition 4 searched for \emph{BAL} in \emph{baldosa}. Participants were assigned to only one condition resulting in no participant seeing both critical words from any single critical word pair during the experiment. %\ttodo{so you still have a between-subject design....} 
For example, participant 1 was assigned to version A of the experiment where they monitored for the syllable \emph{BA} and should have responded when they saw the word \emph{balada} on the screen for the critical word pair \emph{balada–baldosa}. Therefore, participant 1 did not see conditions 2, 3 or 4 in their experiment for \emph{balada–baldosa}. Each participant was assigned to one of the four versions of the experiment based on the order in which they arrived to the experimental location. Rather than running the first set of participants in the same condition, a looping criteria was used to evenly spread out participants across the four versions. For example, participant 1 was assigned to version A, participant 2 was assigned to version B, participant 3 to version C, participant 4 to version D, participant 5 to version A and so on. This between-subjects design will have implications in the analysis because it necessitates the pooling of participant data to make comparisons across participants.

Each version of the experiment presented 24 CV and 24 CVC critical trials where half of each type of syllable structure contained a match between the syllable structure of the target and initial syllable of the word containing the target while the other half are mismatched. Each block presented to the participant contained 1 critical trial and 9 filler trials which were also balanced for CV and CVC syllable structures. Half the blocks presented were real words and half the blocks were nonwords. In no instance did a single block of 10 trials contain both real words and nonwords. All versions of the experiment utilized the same block presentation order, which was randomized using the \emph{=Rand()} function in Excel to obtain the order used in the experiment prior to beginning data collection. While the block order was consistent across all participants, the trial order was randomized for each participant individually. There were 8 practice blocks designed in the same manner that were presented to the participants before the actual experimental blocks were presented. 

\subsection{Procedure}
For the letter sequence monitoring task, participants were instructed that they would be presented with a sequence of letters for which they were to find in a list of words that would appear on the screen one by one. They were instructed to respond only if they had identified the sequence of letters in the word on the screen by pressing the green button on the response box and to do nothing if they did not find the target. The participants were also instructed to respond as fast and accurately as possible. This message was reiterated with feedback screens staggered throughout the experiment encouraging them to respond faster. All feedback messages occurred between blocks of trials and never within a set of trials in a single block. These feedback messages occurred after blocks 6, 13, 18, 27, 32, 36, 41, and 44. These messages were hard coded and always appeared in the same order regardless of how participants were responding. The feedback was meant to be a reminder that the task was to be completed as fast and accurately as possible. Therefore, some examples were asking the participant to speed up---\emph{¡Rápido!; ¡Responda lo más rápido posible!} 'Faster!; Respond as fast as possible!'---while others simply praised the participant and encouraged continued behavior---\emph{¡Bien hecho!; '¡Genial!} 'Good job!; Great!'. 

The participants were first presented with 8 practice blocks that followed the same criteria and procedure as the 48 blocks of experimental trials. Participants were offered a 2-minute break following block 23, which was the midway point of the experiment. Each trial began with text \emph{Encuentre} followed by the sequence of letters, henceforth referred to as the target. The target was presented in all capital letters in the center of the screen. The initial screen of each new block contained the target for 4 seconds before returning to a blank screen for 500 milliseconds. Following the blank screen, a list of ten words was presented randomly one at a time for 2000 milliseconds each with a 150 millisecond interstimulus interval (ISI). Only one word, the carrier item, in each list of ten words contained the target while the other nine words were simply filler items. The target was always found at the beginning of the carrier item. None of the filler items shared any of its first three letters with the target. The search target remained in the upper right hand portion of the screen to serve as a reminder for the entire duration of the 10 individually presented words from the current block. When a response was made, only the first response was recorded, but the experiment did not progress until the 2000 millisecond presentation time had passed. This was done intentionally to avoid the difference of pacing when a response was received. Although this lack of feedback that a response had been made did cause confusion for some participants, no participant appeared to remain confused by this behavior in the experiment by the end of the practice blocks. Once all ten words from the block had been presented, the next block of trials began with a new target for participants to find. This continued until the participant had completed all 48 experimental blocks. In order to illustrate the block and trial system of the experimental design, an example block from the experiment is used. On the first screen, the participants are instructed to find a visually presented fragment \emph{Encuntre BA}, which was shown to them centered on the screen. Then the target is moved to the top right corner of the screen and the first word of the set of 10 were visually presented: \emph{sotana, sonido, picota, torpeza, balada, semilla, rendija, renombre, sordera, tortuga, tersura} and \emph{sortija} 'cassock, sound, cherry, clumsiness, ballad, seed, crevice, renown, deafness, turtle, treasure and ring.' Each word remained on the screen for two seconds before being replaced by the next word in the list. The participants were instructed to press the green button on a button response box using their preferred or dominant hand as soon as they had identified the target in one of the carrier items. They were instructed to do nothing when the fragment was not present. Only one response was expected from the participant during any single block.

The letter sequence monitoring experiment was conducted during the same experimental session as other tasks to reduce the number of required trips to the lab. When participants arrived at the experimental location, they were seated in front of a laptop computer with a USB connected button box in order to complete all experimental tasks in PsychoPy. At the beginning of the experiment, participants entered in basic demographic information as asked in the Basic Language Profile (BLP). Once they had entered their demographic information, they were asked if they had any questions about the procedure and equipment setup. They were also informed that each section of the experimental process would have its own set of instructions that would always reference the color of the button or buttons needed to complete the upcoming section.

All participants began the experimental session with the Spanish vocabulary task---LexTALE-Esp. Starting with this Spanish vocabulary test was an intentional design measure that ensured participants were in Spanish mode by the time they reached experimental tasks where reaction times were being collected. Immediately following the completion of the LexTALE-Esp, participants were given instructions for the practice portion of the visual word segmentation experiment---the monitoring task. Following the practice portion, participants were given a new screen with instructions that indicated they had completed the practice portion, reminded about the controls needed to complete the section, and were allowed to ask any remaining question about the process. When the participant was ready to begin the actual experiment, they pressed the white button on the response box to begin. Once the participants had finished the entire letter sequence monitoring task, they were presented with instructions for the practice trials of the syllabic intuition experiment, which was reported in Chapter \ref{ch-intuition} of this dissertation. Similar to the visual word segmentation experiment, a new set of instructions came on the screen indicating that the practice trials were finished and that they were about to start the actual experiment. Following the syllable intuition experiment, participants completed the LexTALE-Eng task. Once they had completed the English vocabulary test, the Bilingual Language Profile (BLP) was also administered in PyschoPy. For the BLP survey, participants were given access to the keyboard and mouse for easier input of information during survey responses.

\subsection{Analysis}
\label{lab-seg-analysis}
Before the data could be submitted for analysis, some data preparation was still required. The first step in preparing the data for analysis was to remove all the filler trials from the dataset. This left 2160 data points for critical trials by participant. Due to a typo in one of the stimuli, \emph{permiso} 'permission' was displayed as \emph{permsio}. This created a nonword critical item inside of a real word block of filler items. As a result, this item was removed from the analysis resulting in the removal of 10 critical items. Since incorrect responses to critical items were a non-response by the participant, the \Sexpr{length(lab_critical_incorrect$word)} missed items were removed. The last pass removed any individual participant responses under 200 milliseconds---\Sexpr{length(lab_under_200$word)} items---following the lower criteria range used by \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}. The upper cut-off limit was set at 1500 milliseconds, which removed an additional \Sexpr{length(lab_over_1500$word)} items. In total, \Sexpr{length(lab_critical_incorrect$word) + length(lab_under_200$word) + length(lab_over_1500$word) + 10} trials, or \Sexpr{round((length(lab_critical_incorrect$word) + length(lab_under_200$word) + length(lab_over_1500$word))/length(lab_critical$word)*100,2)}\% of the data, were removed leaving \Sexpr{length(lab_my_data$word)} critical data points to be submitted for analysis.

The reaction time data was recorded in milliseconds during the experiment. However, to account for individual differences between participants in terms of reaction times, the reaction time data was log transformed. This accounts for the fact that some participants are generally faster or slower than other participants in general regardless of experimental conditions. The median for these log transformed reactions times were then calculated for each experimental condition by participant.%\ttodo{usually you log-transform if you don't have a normal distribution, but you're not saying that....} 
This was done to prevent large skewing of the mean in cases where participants responded may have responded correctly but slower than usual when compared to their own responses average response times. Thus, using the median was an extra layer of conservatism that allowed for the retention of all data points submitted within the range of 200--1500 milliseconds rather than removing data that was more than 2.5 standard deviations away from the individual participant's mean reaction time. 

Finally, the data was subset into two separate datasets. One dataset was for the control group containing all data points by L1 Spanish speakers and the other was for the target group containing all points given by L1 English speakers. This allowed each dataset to be analyzed individually by group allowing for the comparison of reaction times to experimental conditions between L1 Spanish and L1 English speakers. The datasets were comprised of reaction times by-participant as a function of three experimental conditions: \emph{Target} (CV or CVC syllable structure), \emph{Matching} ("matching" target and word initial syllable matched, "mismatching" target and word initial syllable did not match) and \emph{Lexicality} ("word" a real word in Spanish, "nonword" a nonce word that followed Spanish orthographic rules). The control group dataset of L1 Spanish speakers consisted of 
\Sexpr{nrow(lab_natives)} 
observations---
\Sexpr{length(unique(lab_natives$target_syl_structure))} 
\emph{Target} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(lab_natives$matching))} 
\emph{Matching} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(lab_natives$word_status))} 
\emph{Lexicality} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(lab_natives$partNum))} 
participants, while the target group dataset of L2 Spanish speakers consisted of 
\Sexpr{nrow(lab_learners)} 
observations---
\Sexpr{length(unique(lab_learners$target_syl_structure))} 
\emph{Target} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(lab_learners$matching))} 
\emph{Matching} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(lab_learners$word_status))} 
\emph{Lexicality} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(lab_learners$partNum))} 
participants. Reaction times that were recorded in milliseconds have been used in the descriptive statistics, but they underwent the log transformation prior to running inferential statistics. However, both millisecond and log transformed values were computed by-participant per each condition and were retained in the datasets. All data manipulation and analysis were conducted through the use of R and python scripts available at the project's \href{https://github.com/drakeasberry/Dissertation}{GitHub repository} \parencite{R_Core_Team2020-ib,Python2020-xy}.

It is important to note the differences found in the process and interpretation of analysis results between previous studies and the current one. In previous literature, researchers analyzed the data according to a (2) x (2) ANOVA where the target syllable structure, the syllable for which participants monitored, was the first factor containing two levels---CV and CVC. The second factor was the word-initial syllable of the presented word where the participant could find the target for which they were monitoring. Similarly, the second factor had two levels, which were also CV and CVC structures. In the current project, data was submitted to a (2) x (2) x (2) repeated measures ANOVA because an additional factor of lexical status was added to account for word versus nonword stimuli. Like previous studies, the factor for target syllable structure contained two levels---CV and CVC. However, the current study differs from previous ones because it does not use the word-initial syllable structure as a factor. Instead, the current study uses matching factor with two levels of matching or mismatching. Matching is defined as the condition where the target syllable structure and word-initial syllable structure are the same. Mismatching is where the target syllable structure and the word-initial syllable structure are not the same.%\ttodo{not following here} 
Both of these analyses report the same information, but the visualization of these results looks quite different as shown in Figures \ref{plt-crossover-comp} and \ref{plt-parallel-comp}. In previous studies on the topic, significant results were shown through the interaction between target syllable structure and word-initial syllable structure. The same significant finding in the current study will be realized as a main effect of the matching factor.

\caption[Plot: Crossover Effect]{Shows an example of what the crossover effect results in previous literature using a simulated fictitious dataset. The interaction can be seen in the lines representing the initial syllable structure of the word crossing due to faster detection times from monitoring experiments when the target syllable structure and the word-initial syllable matched structure matched. In order to obtain the crossover effect, the slopes of the two lines had to be different from one another even if they did not actually intersect.}
\label{plt-crossover-comp}

\caption[Plot: Parallel Effect]{Shows an example of what the significant effect results in the current study look like using the same simulated fictitious dataset as Figure \ref{plt-crossover-comp}. The effect can be seen in the parallel lines representing the matching status and target syllable type rather than an interaction between the two factors.}
\label{plt-parallel-comp}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The crossover effect was considered the result of favorable conditions that produced faster reaction times for matching conditions. For example, if a syllabic segmentation strategy is being used, then monitoring for a CV sequence should be detected faster when the presented word has a CV word-initial syllable when compared to a presented word that has a CVC word-initial syllable. Likewise, monitoring for a CVC sequence should be found faster when the word containing the target begins with a CVC word-initial syllable rather than a CV one. In other words, monitoring for a sound or letter sequence that matches the initial syllable structure of the word containing it makes it an easier task. The easier task is marked by the faster reaction times needed to indicate the syllable had been detected. The results of statistical analysis indicated the crossover effect was present with a significant interaction between the search target structure and the initial syllable structure of the presented word containing the target as seen in Figure \ref{plt-crossover-comp}.%\ttodo{note that a significant crossover interaction does not require that the lines actually cross. If they don't cross, but the slopes are significantlu different, that's also a crossover interaction.} 
The current project shows significance through the parallel lines as exemplified in Figure \ref{plt-parallel-comp}. The data in the current study analyzed data by looking target syllable compared to a matching or mismatching condition resulting in parallel lines. In other words, the CV matching and CVC matching conditions are connected by the line representing matching condition and the same holds true for the mismatching condition---CV mismatching is connected to CVC mismatching. If the study finds similar results to previous word segmentation experiments, then it is expected that the mismatching condition will result in longer reaction times than the matching condition for both types of syllables. Therefore, the same analysis is simply being visualized in two different manners. %It is imperative that the reader understand this point because if familiar with the previous research looks at the plots in the manuscript, they may mistakenly assume the results are null or insignificant

For the \Sexpr{length(unique(lab_learners$partNum))} L1 English speakers, the log transformed reaction times were submitted to a (2) x (2) x (2) repeated measures ANOVA with \emph{Lexicality, Target} and \emph{Matching} as factors.

In order to look at main effect of target syllable, post-hoc analyses were conducted. The dataset was regrouped so that each participant's reaction times were computed based on whether the target sequence they were monitoring for was CV or CVC. The dataset consisted of 
\Sexpr{nrow(lab_data_tarsyl_ag)} 
observations---
\Sexpr{length(unique(lab_learners$target_syl_structure))} 
\emph{Target} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(lab_learners$partNum))}.
This dataset was then submitted to a t-test, which revealed that the L2 Spanish group generally detected CVC syllables, 
M= \Sexpr{round(lab_tar_compare["CVC", "Mean"],2)}, 
SD= \Sexpr{round(lab_tar_compare["CVC", "SD"],2)} 
at 95\% CI

faster than CV syllables,

SD= \Sexpr{round(lab_tar_compare["CV", "SD"],2)} 
[\Sexpr{round(lab_tar_compare["CV", "LL"],3)}, 
\Sexpr{round(lab_tar_compare["CV", "UL"],3)}]. 
The mean difference, 
M= \Sexpr{round(abs(lab_tar_compare["CVC", "Mean"] - 
lab_tar_compare["CV", "Mean"]),2)}, 
reveals a statistical difference in detection times between the two target syllable structures,

\Sexpr{round(t_lab_tar_syl_main$statistic,4)}, 
p < \Sexpr{round(t_lab_tar_syl_main$p.value,4)}.
The main effect of target syllable was of a

In order to break down the interaction between \emph{Matching} and \emph{Lexicality} factors, a post-hoc analysis was run. The L2 Spanish dataset was was further subset into two dataframes: one for real words and one for nonwords. Each dataset consisted of 
\Sexpr{nrow(lab_nonwords_learners)} 
observations---
\Sexpr{length(unique(lab_nonwords_learners$matching))} 
\emph{Matching} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(lab_nonwords_learners$partNum))}
participants. Both datasets, words and nonwords, were then individually submitted to a one-tailed t-test. This revealed that the L2 Spanish group did not detect syllables faster in nonword for the matching condition, 
M= \Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["nonword-matching", "Mean"],2)}, 
SD= \Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["nonword-matching", "SD"],2)} 
at 95\% CI 
[\Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["nonword-matching", "LL"],3)}, 
\Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["nonword-matching", "UL"],3)}], 
than syllables detected in the mismatching condition, 
M= \Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["nonword-mismatching", "Mean"],2)}, 
SD= \Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["nonword-mismatching", "SD"],2)} 
[\Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["nonword-mismatching", "LL"],3)}, 
\Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["nonword-mismatching", "UL"],3)}]. 
The mean difference, 
M= \Sexpr{round(abs(lab_mat_lex_compare["nonword-matching", "Mean"] - 
lab_mat_lex_compare["nonword-mismatching", "Mean"]),2)}, 
reveals no statistical difference with regards to the target syllable matching the word initial syllable of the carrier item for nonword, 
\emph{t}(\Sexpr{round(t_lab_l2_nonwd_mat_int$parameter,2)}) = 
\Sexpr{round(t_lab_l2_nonwd_mat_int$statistic,4)}, 
p < \Sexpr{round(t_lab_l2_nonwd_mat_int$p.value,4)}.
In the real word dataset, it surprisingly revealed that the L2 Spanish group detected syllables significantly slower for the matching condition, 
M= \Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["word-matching", "Mean"],2)}, 
SD= \Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["word-matching", "SD"],2)} 
at 95\% CI 
[\Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["word-matching", "LL"],3)}, 
\Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["word-matching", "UL"],3)}], 
than syllables detected in the mismatching condition, 
M= \Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["word-mismatching", "Mean"],2)}, 
SD= \Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["word-mismatching", "SD"],2)} 
[\Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["word-mismatching", "LL"],3)}, 
\Sexpr{round(lab_mat_lex_compare["word-mismatching", "UL"],3)}]. 
The mean difference, 
M= \Sexpr{round(abs(lab_mat_lex_compare["word-matching", "Mean"] - 
lab_mat_lex_compare["word-mismatching", "Mean"]),2)}, 
reveals a statistically significant difference with regards to the target syllable matching the word initial syllable of the carrier item for words, but opposite of the hypothesized direction, 
\emph{t}(\Sexpr{round(t_lab_l2_wd_mat_int$parameter,2)}) = 
\Sexpr{round(t_lab_l2_wd_mat_int$statistic,4)}, 
p < \Sexpr{round(t_lab_l2_wd_mat_int$p.value,4)}.
The effect size of matching condition in the word dataset was also 
\Sexpr{lab_l2_mat_efsize$magnitude} 
in magnitude, \emph{d}= 
\Sexpr{round(lab_l2_mat_efsize$estimate,2)},

Figure \ref{plt-lab_l2_mat_lex_s_int} plots the estimated marginal means for the interaction between \emph{Matching} and \emph{Lexicality} for L2 learners of Spanish. It shows that the significant interaction was due to the fact that participants responded significantly to the the mismatching condition than the matching condition, but only for real words. Lastly, the data reveals that the interaction between target syllable structure and the structure word initial syllable of carrier word was not significant as can be seen in Figure \ref{plt-lab-l2-tar-mat-ns-int}. There was no significant main effect of \emph{Matching}

\section{Discussion}
This chapter reported on the \Sexpr{length(unique(lab_my_data$partNum))} participants who completed a visual Spanish letter sequence monitoring experiment. Crucially, the experiment run in this chapter attempted to replicate the findings of previous research in terms of Spanish letter sequence monitoring abilities as an indicator of the use of a syllabic segmentation strategy with its \Sexpr{length(unique(lab_natives$partNum))} L1 Spanish speaker controls. It sought to extend the use of the letter sequence monitoring experimental design to address the questions of whether or not the \Sexpr{length(unique(lab_learners$partNum))} L1 English speakers participants who were L2 learners of Spanish could utilize a syllabic segmentation strategy when processing Spanish. 

In terms of replication, the \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} results were replicated in the our L1 Spanish speaker control group. Replicating the null effect for L1 Spanish speakers was surprising. It went against the hypothesis for the control group in this chapter and the monolingual data that suggested L1 Spanish speakers employ a syllable-based segmentation strategy. These L2 learners of English did not continue to exhibit behavior of syllabic segmentation. While this was portion of the experiment was not the main focus of the study, the results did confirm the findings of Spanish--English bilinguals \parencite{Bradley1993-qq}. \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} suggested that potential factor causing the absence of the syllabic segmentation strategy in the Spanish--English bilinguals was the fact that all their participants had immigrated and lived in an English speaking region for a minimum of three years. Their results combined with those of the current study would suggest that this factor was not the main reason for the abandonment of a syllabic segmentation strategy. All participants in the current study were born, raised and continued to reside in their L1 Spanish speaking region. \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} results combined with those of the current study would suggest that the dominant language of residing region was not the main factor for the abandonment of a syllabic segmentation strategy. The results of the Spanish--English bilinguals are the not the first time that bilinguals have been found to alter the use of a syllabic segmentation strategy. \textcite{Cutler1992-qq} initially found that French--English bilinguals appeared to have abandoned their syllabic segmentation strategy. However, once they considered language dominance, the French dominant bilinguals showed evidence of syllabic segmentation in a French monitoring experiment, but not in an English monitoring experiment.  While \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} discussed language dominance in terms of questions answered to survey, they do not directly address this factor in their analysis of the monitoring experiment. Therefore, they mentioned participants under 30 years of age favored English while those over 30 favored Spanish, which led to a mixed group of language dominance for their analysis. Their results may have been similar to the pooled group of French-English bilinguals \textcite{Cutler1992-qq}. The participants in \textcite{Cutler1992-qq} once split by language dominance showed that French dominant bilinguals of English could utilize the syllable segmentation strategy where it was effective and inhibit its use in English where it was not. The current results reported in this study have taken language dominance into consideration before analyzing the monitoring data to ensure that the bilingual control group was indeed Spanish dominant. Even in Spanish dominant bilinguals continuing to reside in their L1 environment, the evidence of the syllabic segmentation strategy was not found in the Spanish monitoring experiment. While a conclusive claim cannot be made based on the results of the current study, it seems that some factor or combination of factors may be at play in terms of bilingual segmentation strategies, which extend beyond simplistic classifications of native language, residency, geographic location and language dominance.

Now turning the attention to main group of interest in the current study, it was found that the L2 learners of Spanish also did not show any signs of a syllabic segmentation strategy. For L1 English speakers, finding a null effect was expected based on previous findings and in line with the hypothesis. All previous research on English syllable-based segmentation pointed to it not being implemented when English was one of the languages spoken. In addition, this finding was not overly surprising given that the control group of L1 Spanish speakers did not show evidence of the syllabic strategy with the same materials. Previous literature has shown that English speakers generally have not displayed evidence of syllabic segmentation strategies even when monitored languages would have supported it \parencite{Bradley1993-qq,Cutler1986-zl,Cutler1992-qq}. While there were no signs pointing to the utilization of syllables being used to segment the Spanish words, participants did show a preference of monitoring for CVC sequences. This was revealed in the reaction time data as CVC sequences were detected faster than CV sequences. %\ttodo{why would this main effect be there, be useful} 
They also showed sensitivity to the condition of matching, but only with real words. This finding was quite unexpected as it indicated the direction of this effect was in the opposite direction as the one hypothesized. In other words, participants were much faster at detecting the letter sequence for which they were monitoring when it did not match the syllable structure of the word initial syllable. Up to this point, a syllable segmentation effect has always been reported as the the result of the target matching the word initial syllable structure of the word. One possible explanation for these findings is it that participants were not  processing the words and nonwords in the same manner.\ttodo{again, worth looking at fast and slow subjects here.} In other words, they could have been making decisions prelexically for nonwords and postlexically for words. Another possibility is that they were utilizing a subsyllabic unit to such as the rime to make their decision while ignoring the onset allowing them to make faster decisions for closed syllables, CVC ones, than for open syllables---CV ones. This would allow for the matching versus mismatching effect to be masked by some process of orthographic letter recognition rather than the actual phonological activation process the design was intended to test.

Turning to the main research question of the current study, there are several reasons that could potentially cause the null results for target and carrier item syllable structures to be present in the current experiment. The first of which may be the sample size of the groups. %\ttodo{au: This is not a grammatical sentence.} 
For instance, there were no significant factors in the control group. However, the L1 Spanish control group was much smaller the L1 English group---about two thirds of the size. While the learner group did reveal some significant factors, although not where had been hypothesized, it was still a small sample size. Even though the learner group size was comparable to previous research group sizes, a problem with replication in linguistic studies is not uncommon \parencite{Grieve2021-qa,Plant2016-nv}. A suggestion for future researcher would be to conduct power analysis prior to beginning data collection. This needs to take into consideration the size of the expected effect based off of previous results or that of a pilot study in the event where novel research is taking place. Researchers should also carefully consider the level of confidence they would like to have when making claims based off their results. Considering these factors into future experimental designs will not only help researchers used data-driven decisions in determining sample sizes needed for their experiments, but may also help alleviate the replication crisis found in many language-based research designs.

A logical factor to consider is reaction time. Reaction times were a factor that affected previous results and seemed to have caused the effect  to disappear when participant reaction times were very fast. It appeared that people were able to skip the syllable segmentation strategy when segmenting words very quickly, which can be seen in the results of \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd}. %\ttodo{au: Please explain this more clearly.} 
In their second experiment, the average reaction times for monitoring in Spanish ranged from 355 ms to 394 ms and the researchers did not find the syllabic segmentation effect. However, the average RTs in the current study ranged between 529 ms and 561 ms, which were similar to previous studies that did find an effect of the syllable in segmentation. Experiment 3 of \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} increased the reaction times of participants, 586 ms to 643 ms, by adding a semantic relationship task to their design and the syllabic effect reemerged. Similarly, \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} also found a syllabic effect when monitoring in Spanish when reaction times of their Spanish monolingual participants ranged from 556 ms to 609 ms. On the other hand, the bilingual Spanish--English group studied in \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} ranged from 469 ms to 524 ms and did not find the effect. The current group was most similar to this previously studied bilingual Spanish--English participant and their reaction time ranges fell between those studies that did not find an effect and those that did. It is possible that an attempt to slow these bilinguals down a little more by following the methodology of \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} could push the reaction times over that 600 ms mark and cause the effect to emerge. It is possible that the slower the reaction times in the current study as compared to \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} stemmed from the mixed design using words and nonwords. It may be that this switch between lexicality status caused a delay in participants was not as strong as the one caused by explicitly telling participants to look for the semantic relationship between presented words.

Looking to design differences, the use of a Latin square design in combination with the mix of word and nonword sets may have neutralized the effect. Due to the Latin square design and the four conditions in the experimental design, it was impossible to make comparisons within subjects for targets. %\ttodo{au: I'm not sure what this means - this needs further clarification. Typically, using a Latin square is exactly what enables such comparisons.} 
Since no participant saw both stimuli in the word- or nonword-pairs, Therefore, a between subjects comparison was necessary to compare reaction times of \emph{ba} and \emph{bal} in real word and nonword lists in order to draw any conclusion about the syllable structures role in segmentation. For example, if one participant searched for \emph{ba} in a real word list, then they would have had to search for the target \emph{bal} in a nonword list. A second participants would have seen the exact opposite scenario where they searched for \emph{bal} in a real word list and \emph{ba} in a nonword list. Therefore, to draw a conclusion about syllabic segmentation in terms of mathcing conditions facilitatory effect, comparisions would have to be made between the two participants. Another major design difference between the current study and the previous ones was the use of visual word recognition paradigm. The current study assumed that visual input is filtered through the phonology. However, one could argue that the null result found in this chapter was the culprit. This visual presentation of targets and stimuli was utilized to prevent confounds of co-articulation. Due the visual nature of the experimental design, it is certain that no inadvertent phonetic detail was able to affect results here as was possible in the auditory designs. The replication of \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} fifth experiment with bilingual Spanish--English participants suggests that visual methodology works just as well as auditory one. In fact the visual methodology seemed to produce even longer reaction times than those found by \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}, which have been shown to be necessary to capture the syllabic effect in Spanish segmentation. In Chapter \ref{ch-seg-online}, the dissertation attempts to address some of these concerns through a replication of this experiment through an online setting.

%The results of direct elicitation of initial syllable structure showed a consistent syllabification pattern between participants. \ttodo{this is a good sentence}

%The previous literature showed the crossover effect because they analyzed their data over target syllable structure and carrier syllable structure. Our parallel pattern tells the same story \ttodo{the same story is too colloquial. It is also misleading because previous research DID find an effect with the exception of Bradley et. al. However, I DID NOT find an effect in this current chapter and this description is not clearly stated in its current format.} but simply analyzed over target syllable structure and matching condition. In both cases the conditions analyzed included CV target--CV carrier and CVC target--CVC carrier (matching conditions), CV target--CVC carrier and CVC target--CV carrier (mismatching conditions).
%Another avenue to investigate would be the syllabic intuitions of participants, which could be a factor given that English and Spanish differ in ways similar to English and French participants of previous research studies. 

%It may be that the two groups do not agree on the syllabic structures of the speech they are segmenting as a result of L1 backgrounds. Syllabic intuitions from both groups were collected in a syllabic intuition experiment that was conducted and results are discussed in Chapter \ref{ch-intuition} of the current project.
