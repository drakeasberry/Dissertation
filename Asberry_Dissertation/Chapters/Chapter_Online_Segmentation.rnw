\section{Introduction}
This chapter and the experiments within it were conducted to further investigate the results found in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} for the visual letter sequence monitoring task. The results of the previous chapter went against the hypothesis that Spanish--English bilinguals would employ a syllable-based segmentation strategy in Spanish. This finding was very surprising in terms of the Spanish dominant bilinguals because Spanish monolinguals had been shown to use this strategy. In English dominant bilinguals, there was also no effect of syllable segmentation. This finding was more expected given the amount of research that suggested that English speakers did not rely of syllable-based segmentation strategies. However, the research on English bilinguals was scarce and Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} had sought to test whether or not this strategy was learnable by second language learners of Spanish.

In order to further investigate, the current chapter utilized Spanish monolinguals and a group of different participants recruited for the English dominant bilinguals. The design of the study was also modified in order to isolate particular aspects thought to be contributing to the null effects found for a syllable-based word segmentation strategy in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}. This chapter conducted a second visual letter sequence monitoring task in order to address the following research questions: 1) Is there support for a syllable-based segmentation strategy when processing Spanish? and 2) How does the use of syllable-based segmentation strategies for processing the Spanish language differ between L1 speakers of Spanish and L1 English speakers? 

The next section is the background of the project. Given that the background is the same as Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, only a small summary has been given of the previous literature. Readers interested in reading more detail on these topics should refer to Chapter \ref{ch-intro} and Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} Section \ref{lab-seg-background}.


\section{Background}
There have been many research studies looking for evidence of the use of a syllabic-based word segmentation strategy. A syllabic segmentation strategy has mostly been reported in terms of an interaction between the syllable structure of letter or sound sequence, the target, and the structure of the initial syllable in a word in which the participant was supposed to identify the target. One thing that is abundantly clear is that this strategy is used differently by speakers according to their language backgrounds.

There have been differences found within monolingual speakers of a single language as well as differences between monolingual and bilinguals where one language is shared in common. Monolingual French speakers were reported to use a syllable segmentation strategy consistently even when language input that had shown the lack of this strategy's efficacy by native speakers. On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, monolingual English speakers never employed a syllabic segmentation strategy even when the language input would promote it \parencite{Cutler1986-zl,Mehler1981-vi}. \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} extended the previous French results found in \textcite{Mehler1981-vi} to Spanish monolinguals. Spanish speakers seemed to be able to process items so fast that they could skip the use of the syllable segmentation strategy. However, if Spanish speakers were forced to slow down, then evidence of the syllable segmentation strategy emerged for words with an unstressed first syllable \parencite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd}. The results for the Spanish study in \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} also found the syllabic effect when response times averaged between 556 and 609 milliseconds. 

In terms of bilinguals, \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} investigated Spanish--English bilinguals using the same material where the syllabic segmentation effect had been found for Spanish monolinguals in an attempt to replicate the French--English bilinguals studied by \textcite{Cutler1992-qq}. While \textcite{Cutler1992-qq} found a syllabic segmentation effect for French dominant English bilinguals when monitoring in French, \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} was unsuccessful at finding a similar result with Spanish dominant English bilinguals when monitoring in Spanish. In Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} of this dissertation, Spanish--English bilinguals, split between Spanish and English dominance, completed a visual letter sequence monitoring task. Like \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}, these bilinguals from Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} showed no evidence of a syllabic segmentation strategy.


\section{Present Study}
%\ttodo[inline]{da: Bilinguals caused all new types of possibilities. List all the things it could have been. I changed three things here: bilinguals to monolinguals, removed the Latin-square design and went online. The most important thing is that I stuck to a visual study methods which is my deepest question at this point.}
The current study conducted a Spanish visual letter sequence monitoring task with L1 Spanish and L1 English speakers. This experiment is a follow-up to the letter sequence monitoring experiment conducted in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}. In the previous chapter's findings, Spanish dominant bilinguals of English did not show the effects of a syllable-based segmentation strategy. This was also in line with previous findings for Spanish--English bilinguals \parencite{Bradley1993-qq}. One possible explanation of this result was that the experimental items were somehow responsible for the null effect. In order to address the issue of experimental items, the current study ran a replication study of \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}, which did find a syllabic effect in monolingual speakers of Spanish. Utilizing a subset of the same materials used in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, the visual Spanish letter sequence monitoring task was given to monolingual speakers of Spanish. This allowed for the isolation of learning English to be controlled for in the L1 Spanish speaker control group. Support for syllabic segmentation in the current chapter would provide stronger evidence that the learning of English is somehow affecting L1 Spanish speakers' decision to continue using their L1 syllable-based segmentation strategy even when processing their native language based on the results of Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}. If the Spanish monolinguals also do not show evidence of the syllable-based segmentation strategy, then it is likely due to some property of the experimental items or the mode of presentation---auditorily or visually. On the other hand, if the results support the use of the syllable-based strategy, then the effects of experimental item properties. Although the experimental items themselves could be ruled out as the factor masking syllabic segmentation, the removal of the Latin square experimental design could also be responsible. The current study does not have a way to distinguish between the two factors because the number of factors changed was kept to a minimum. However, if a syllabic segmentation support is found, a future experiment could test the L1 Spanish-L2 English bilingual experiment following the current chapter's experimental design. Only if support was found in this new group, could the Latin square design be looked into as the factor contributing to the masking the syllabic segmentation effect. If support for syllable-based segmentation is found in the current study, additional support for the use of a visual paradigm to study these types of phonological effects will be provided. If support for syllable-based segmentation is not found in the L1 Spanish group, then using a visual methodology to study these phonological processes would need to be brought under further scrutiny.

In addition to running a replication of \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}, the main goal of this dissertation was to extend findings to second language learners of Spanish who were L1 speakers of English. This target group, has only been tested in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} up to this point. In the findings of the previous chapter, the ability to learn and employ a syllabic segmentation strategy  after acquiring a second language that supports it was not upheld. However, Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} experiments suffered from small sample sizes. Therefore, the current study conducted a one-sided paired samples t-test power analysis prior to online data collection beginning to ensure a sufficient sample size was collected in order to support confident interpretations of the analyses that were to be conducted. The power analysis showed that 41 participants were needed in order to have a 0.8 probability of capturing a minimally interesting effect size of $\delta \geq$ 0.4 while allowing for a maximum Type 1 error rate of $\alpha$ = 0.05 \parencite{The_Jamovi_Project2020-lw}. As before, there were two possible outcomes for the L1 English--L2 Spanish experimental group. Previous research had shown that a syllable-based segmentation strategy was not productive for L1 English speakers or when English was one of a person's known languages \parencite{Bradley1993-qq,Cutler1986-zl,Cutler1992-qq,Mehler1981-vi}. Evidence for the ability to learn the syllable-based segmentation strategy would be supported if the group of English--Spanish bilinguals showed a sensitivity to syllabic structure when processing Spanish. Evidence of this sensitivity would be revealed as a factor of the target structure for which they were monitoring in relation to whether or not it matched the word initial syllable structure of the word containing the target. The other possible outcome is that they do not show this sensitivity to syllabic structure when processing Spanish. This finding would be in-line with numerous previous findings that have shown English speakers do not implement a syllabic segmentation strategy despite the fact that the language they are processing supports it.

In order to address these questions and possible outcomes, an online visual letter sequence monitoring task was conducted to analyze the word segmentation strategies used by the participants. During the online visual monitoring experiment, a two or three letter string that represented a CV or CVC syllable appeared on the participant's computer screen. Once the target presentation occurred, the words or nonwords were then individually presented to the participants. The instructions asked participants to respond as quickly as possible once they identified the matching letter string. Both the letter stings, i.e. targets, and the stimuli were presented visually. This dissertation tested the syllable segmentation strategy in a completely visual manner. It builds on the assumption that reading actually activates the phonology in the mind of the participant. As with Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, the online experimental design assumed that participants were actually activating the phonological representation of the sounds of the target, i.e. CV or CVC syllable, and the word they read on the screen. For a full discussion on this topic, refer to Chapter \ref{ch-intro} Section \ref{sec-phon-activation}. 

Running an online study also introduced another factor to be considered when preparing to collect data. In Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, all participants completed the experiments on the same computer where hardware and software configurations were consistent across all participants. All participant responses were collected with a USB button response box. However, the experiment in the current chapter was built using PsychoPy3 version 2020.1.2 and hosted online using Pavlovia \parencite{Bridges2020-el}. This resulted in the lack of control for hardware configurations, browser selection and input devices. Participants were recruited from Prolific, which did allow for restricting user devices to a laptop or desktop computer. Participants were not allowed to participate from mobile devices or tablets \parencite{noauthor_2020-xx}. However, several studies were published around the same time as the data being collected for the experiment in this chapter that showed online reaction time studies were viable options \parencite{Bridges2020-el,Pronk2020-qg}. Visual studies conducted online were actually found to be comparable to laboratory-based experiments. In terms of reaction time collection, visual experiments were only slightly more variable while auditory studies continued to lag behind in-person ones \parencite{Bridges2020-el,Plant2016-nv}. Thus, continuing to use a visual paradigm to study word segmentation strategies in Spanish was a logical choice.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Participants}
All participants reported in this chapter were recruited for experiments that were conducted online. In this study, L1 monolingual Spanish speakers were used as the control group. The target group consisted of L1 English speakers who were second language learners of Spanish. No participant from the L1 English group in this chapter took part in any previous study reported on in Chapters \ref{ch-intuition} or \ref{ch-seg-lab}. All participants recruited for the online visual letter sequence monitoring experiment continued to live in their L1 environment, or birth country, at the time of data collection. There were \Sexpr{online_completed["Monolingual Spanish", "n"]} participants in L1 Spanish group recruited from Mexico and \Sexpr{online_completed["L2 Learner", "n"]} participants in L1 English group recruited from United States. In total, \Sexpr{online_completed["L2 Learner", "n"] + online_completed["Monolingual Spanish", "n"]} participants completed the experiment. For a full description of each group see Chapter \ref{ch-sampling} Section \ref{sec-participants}.

Language knowledge and participant background data was collected through the LexTALE-Esp and a subset of questions from the Bilingual Language Profile (BLP) \parencite{Birdsong2012-wd}. These additional tasks were completed during the same experimental session as the letter sequence monitoring experiment. Additional demographic and linguistic history data was provided by Prolific \parencite{noauthor_2020-xx}. The LexTALE-Esp provided vocabulary knowledge of Spanish for all participants \parencite{Izura2014-yw}. The full BLP could not be implemented for the participants of this study because it was not designed for monolinguals as it teases apart the use of two or more languages a participant speaks. Since monolinguals only have one language, the output of questionnaire would not produce data that was informative. Unlike the process in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} where participants had to have demographic data checked to ensure they met the criteria for the group they had been recruited, the Prolific filters took care of this before a participant was given the opportunity to participate. Prolific required all screening, filtering based on inclusion criteria, to be correctly set up using pre-built filters provided by Prolific. The filters used for L1 Spanish included \emph{Country of Birth, Current Country of Residence, First Language} and \emph{Bilingual}. L1 English group used the same filter as the L1 Spanish group and two additional filters of \emph{Were you raised monolingual?} and \emph{Fluent Languages}. Nonetheless, the subset of BLP questions that appeared at the start of the experiment served to cross-check the data input by the participant on Prolific's website. Following guidelines set forth by Prolific, inconsistencies between BLP questions and Prolific profile data resulted in communication with participants through the Prolific website. Participants that were found to have discrepancies were asked to update profiles, their data was deleted and they did not receive compensation. 

An accuracy response rate for the experiment was conducted for participants following the demographic cross-validations. As in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, a predetermined accuracy rate of 90 percent was used as the cut-off and any participant responding incorrectly to filler or critical trials more than 10 percent of the time was removed from the analysis. The design of the experiment was used go/no go trials where participants responded only when they detected what they had been instructed to look for. In all other trials, participants were not supposed to respond. Therefore, the 10 percent cut-off was used as a measure of participant engagement in the task. If participants failed to respond to more than 10 percent of the trials, they were likely distracted and not fully engaged with the task. The study relied on reactions times and needed to collect them from engaged participants rather than including reaction times of distracted participants, which would likely be skewed and inconsistent with the individual. \Sexpr{online_stat_dropped["L2 Learner", "n"] + online_stat_dropped["Monolingual Spanish", "n"]} participants were removed for committing errors at rate greater than 10 percent to critical trials. \Sexpr{online_stat_dropped["L2 Learner", "n"]} participants from the L1 English group and \Sexpr{online_stat_dropped["Monolingual Spanish", "n"]} participants from the L1 Spanish group were removed. This left a total of \Sexpr{online_eligible["L2 Learner", "n"] + online_eligible["Monolingual Spanish", "n"]} participants---\Sexpr{online_eligible["L2 Learner", "n"]} L1 English speakers and \Sexpr{online_eligible["Monolingual Spanish", "n"]} L1 Spanish speakers, that had data submitted to the analysis. Only these participants are included in reported statistics and figures below.

\subsection{Materials \& Design}
There are several terms, which need to be understood in order to fully grasp the experimental design. The first is \emph{target}, which is the 2 or 3 letter sequence that the participant needed detect. The second is \emph{block}, which is defined as a list of 10 trials presented to the participant where they were searching for one single target. \emph{Trials} are each individual words that was presented to the participant to which they could respond. Trials were split into two types. The first was \emph{filler} where no participant response was expected because the target could not be detected in the trial word being presented. The second type was \emph{critical}, which is where the target should be detected by the participant and a response was expected. The words in filler trials are referred to as \emph{fillers} while the words in the critical trials are referred to as \emph{carriers} in remainder of this chapter.

Using a subset of critical word pairs used in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, eight real word pairs and eight nonword pairs were selected as critical items for the current experiment. As before, the design of the initial syllable structure varied between a CV and a CVC structure while the first three phonemes were shared between the two words. %The practice trials included the target pairings of \emph{GA--GAR} and \emph{JO--JOR}. The critical item pairs for the practice trials included words---\emph{garaje--garanta} 'garage--throat' and \emph{jo.ro.ba--jor.na.da} 'hump--day'---and nonwords---\emph{ga.re.le--gar.ven.ta} and \emph{jo.ru.ma--jor.te.da}. This provided the participant with two examples of each experimental condition they would encounter in the actual experiment. 
Example real word pairs included: \emph{ca.mi.sa--cam.pa.na} 'shirt--campaign' and \emph{mo.ne.da--mon.ta.ña} 'currency--mountain'. These examples had nonword counter parts that included \emph{ca.mo.fa--cam.be.na} and \emph{mo.ni.ga--mon.se.ña} respectively. The targets for these word and nonword pairings were \emph{CA--CAM} and \emph{MO--MON}.

In addition to the eight critical real word pairs, another 288 real Spanish word fillers were balanced according to initial syllable structure---144 started with a CV syllable and 144 started with a CVC syllable. Likewise, in addition to the eight critical nonword pairs, 288 nonwords were selected and counterbalanced for initial syllable structure. All critical items and fillers were trisyllabic and stressed on the penultimate syllable. The nonwords used in this chapter were created from the 48 real Spanish words from Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, which were submitted to a nonword generator called Wuggy \parencite{Keuleers2010-vq}. See Appendix \ref{app-wuggy} for all instructions and parameters used in creating the nonwords and a complete list of experimental items used in the current chapter are found in Appendix \ref{segmentation-stimuli}. The \emph{ca.mi.sa--cam.pa.na} word pairing  will be used to illustrate the block and trial design for the targets \emph{CA--CAM}. In one real-word block, the target is \emph{CA} and the carrier item \emph{camisa} is found in the single critical trial contained within this block while the remaining nine trials are fillers. In this block the target matches the word-initial syllable of the carrier. In another block of the experiment, the target \emph{CA} is searched for again, but this time the critical trial is \emph{campana}. In this case, the target does not match the word-initial syllable structure of the carrier and is referred to as the mismatching condition in the current study. Two additional blocks are also presented for the target \emph{CAM}. Again one carrier is the matching condition \emph{campana}, while the other carrier is the mismatching condition \emph{camisa}. The nonword pairing counterpart \emph{ca.mo.fa--cam.be.na} follows the same design resulting in four additional nonword experimental blocks. There were 16 practice blocks designed in the same manner as the experimental blocks that were presented to the participants before the actual experimental blocks were presented. %This large number of practice blocks was necessitated by the fact that participants saw all conditions in the experiment. Since one word and nonword pairing each contained eight total conditions, 2 words matching, 2 words mismatching, 2 nonwords matching and 2 nonwords mismatching, the practice trial only included two word pairs and two nonword pairs. This gave participants two examples of all conditions they would encounter in the same balanced proportion as the actual experiment.

The experiment was run completely in Spanish and there were two different versions. The only difference between the two versions was the questions that were asked at the start screen of the online experiment. Appendix \ref{app-blp} lists all questions asked at the start up screen of the experiment for both L1 monolinguals of Spanish and L1 English--L2 learners of Spanish. In Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, four versions of the experiment were necessary for counter-balancing purposes of the Latin square design, which was accomplished by balancing across participants. For example, participants in condition 1 searched for \emph{BA} in \emph{balada}, participants in condition 2 searched for \emph{BAL} in \emph{balada}, participants in condition 3 searched for \emph{BA} in \emph{baldosa} and participants in condition 4 searched for \emph{BAL} in \emph{baldosa} for the word-pair \emph{balada–baldosa}. Participants were assigned to only one condition resulting in no participant seeing both critical words from any single critical word pair during the experiment. However, the Latin square design was removed from the current experiment and each participant saw all four conditions for the word-pair \emph{balada–baldosa}. They also saw all four conditions for the nonword counterpart pair \emph{balega-balbusa}. The experiment presented 64 critical trials---32 CV and 32 CVC---where half of each contained a match between the syllable structure of the target and initial syllable of the word containing the target while the other half mismatched. One critical trial and nine filler trials made up each block presented to the participant. Real words were presented in half the blocks while nonwords were presented in the other half. No single block of 10 trials contained both real words and nonwords. 

A second difference found between the visual letter sequence monitoring task in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} and the one in the current chapter is randomization. In the previous experiment, all experimental conditions utilized the same block presentation order across all participants while the trial order was randomized for each participant individually. In the current chapter, the experiment is completely randomized. Not only were the fillers and critical items within a block randomized, but also the presentation order of the trial blocks was randomized for each participant.


\subsection{Procedure}
For the letter sequence monitoring task, participants were instructed that they would be presented with a sequence of letters for which they were to find in a list of words that would appear on the screen one by one. They were instructed to respond only if they had identified the sequence of letters in the word on the screen by pressing the \emph{b} key on their keyboard. If they did not find the target in the presented word, they were to do nothing and wait for the presentation of the next word. Feedback messages were given on separate screens sporadically throughout the experiment to remind them to respond as fast and accurately as possible. All feedback messages occurred between blocks of trials and never within trials from a single block. These feedback messages occurred after blocks 8, 18, 24, 36, 48, 57 and 61. These messages were hard coded and always appeared in the same order regardless of how participants were actually responding. Several examples asked the participant to speed up---\emph{¡Rápido!; ¡Responda lo más rápido posible!} 'Faster!; Respond as fast as possible!'---while others praised and encouraged the participant to continue their behavior---\emph{¡Bien hecho!; '¡Genial!} 'Good job!; Great!'. 

The participants were first presented with 16 practice blocks that followed the same criteria and procedure as the 64 blocks of experimental trials. Participants were offered a 2-minute break following block 31, which was the midway point of the experimental task. Each trial began with text \emph{Encuentre} followed by the sequence of letters, referred to as the target. The target was presented in all capital letters in the center of the screen. The initial screen of each new block contained the target for 4 seconds before returning to a blank screen for 500 milliseconds. Following the blank screen, a list of ten words was presented randomly one at a time for 2000 milliseconds each with a 150 millisecond interstimulus interval (ISI). Only one word, the carrier item, in each list of ten words contained the target while the other nine words were simply filler items. The target was always found at the beginning of the carrier item. None of the filler items shared any of its first three letters with the target. The search target remained in the upper right hand portion of the screen to serve as a reminder for the entire duration of the 10 individually presented words from the current block. When a response was made, only the first response was recorded, but the experiment did not progress until the 2000 millisecond presentation time had passed. This was done intentionally to avoid the difference of pacing when a response was received. During in-person experiments reported on in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, this caused some confusion due to lack of response feedback. However, all participants seemed to understand this behavior by the end of the practice blocks. Once all ten words from the block had been presented, the next block of trials began with a new target for participants to find. This continued until the participant had completed all 64 experimental blocks. In order to illustrate the block and trial system of the experimental design, an example block from the experiment is used. On the first screen, \emph{Encuntre BA} instructed the participants to find the visually presented letter sequence appearing on center screen. Then the target was displayed in the top right corner of the screen and the first word of the block of 10 trials was visually presented: \emph{sotana, sonido, picota, torpeza, balada, semilla, rendija, renombre, sordera, tortuga, tersura} and \emph{sortija} 'cassock, sound, cherry, clumsiness, ballad, seed, crevice, renown, deafness, turtle, treasure and ring.' Each word remained on the screen for two seconds before being replaced by the next word in the list. The participants registered their response by pressing the \emph{b} on their keyboard using their preferred or dominant hand as soon as they had identified the target in one of the carrier items. Since they were instructed to do nothing when the fragment was not present, only one response was expected from the participant during any single block.

The letter sequence monitoring experiment was conducted during the same experimental session as other tasks. Participants accessed the online experiment from their personal computers using their preferred internet browser in order to complete all experimental tasks in PsychoJS \parencite{Bridges2020-el}. At the beginning of the experiment, participants entered in basic demographic information as asked in the Basic Language Profile (BLP). The BLP questionnaire was not used in its entirety and had different questions depending on whether the participant was a L1 Spanish speaker or a L1 English speaker. A complete list of questions asked to each group can be found in Appendix \ref{app-blp}. Following the submission of demographic questions, participants were shown the instructions for the LexTale-ESP---the Spanish vocabulary task. Starting with this Spanish vocabulary task ensured L1 English participants were in Spanish mode by the time they completed experimental tasks where reaction times were collected. Upon completion of the LexTALE-Esp, participants were given the instructions for the practice trials of the letter sequence monitoring task. Once these practice trials were completed, they received a second instruction screen that informed them that they had completed the practice trials, reminded of the input controls and told they would begin the actual letter sequence monitoring experiment. Once the participants had finished the entire letter sequence monitoring task, they were presented with a screen thanking them for their time and participation.


\subsection{Analysis}
Several data wrangling and cleaning steps had to be completed before the data could be submitted for the analysis described below. As in the Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, millisecond reaction times were recorded during the experiment. Similarly, the reaction time data underwent a log transformation. This accounted for individual differences between participants who were generally faster or slower than other participants. In order to deal with skewing that could occur for responses within a participant, the median of the log transformed reactions times was calculated for each experimental condition by participant. Unlike the in-person visual monitoring experiment, subsetting the dataset into two separated datasets each representing a single group was unnecessary. This was not required in the current chapter because the two versions of the online experiment created two different datasets at the time of data collection. 

The L1 Spanish group dataset contained \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l1_raw_data)} recorded trials---784 rows for each of the \Sexpr{length(unique(online_l1_exper_trials$partNum))} participants. The first step in preparing the data for analysis was to remove all the practice trials, \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l1_raw_data) - nrow(online_l1_exper_trials)} trials, which left \Sexpr{nrow(online_l1_exper_trials)}. Next all the filler trials were removed from the dataset leaving \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l1_critical_data)} data points for critical trials by participant. Since incorrect responses to critical items were a non-response by the participant, the \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l1_critical_data) - nrow(my_online_l1_critical_correct)} missed critical items were removed. Following the cut off criteria range used by \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} and the criteria in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, the last pass removed any individual participant response under 200 milliseconds and over 1500 milliseconds. The lower limit resulted in \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l1_critical_correct) - nrow(my_online_l1_under_200)} response being removed while the upper limit removed an additional \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l1_under_200) - nrow(my_online_l1_over_1500)} responses. In total, \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l1_critical_data) - nrow(my_online_l1_critical_correct) + nrow(my_online_l1_critical_correct) - nrow(my_online_l1_under_200) + nrow(my_online_l1_under_200) - nrow(my_online_l1_over_1500)} trials or \Sexpr{round((nrow(my_online_l1_critical_data) - nrow(my_l1_data)) / nrow(my_online_l1_critical_data)*100,2)}\% of the data were removed leaving \Sexpr{nrow(my_l1_data)} L1 Spanish critical data points to be submitted for analysis.

The same process used in preparing the L1 Spanish group data was followed for the L1 English group. The L1 English group dataset contained \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l2_raw_data)} recorded trials---784 rows for each of the \Sexpr{length(unique(online_l2_exper_trials$partNum))} participants. All \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l2_raw_data) - nrow(online_l2_exper_trials)} practice trials were removed leaving \Sexpr{nrow(online_l2_exper_trials)} experimental trials. \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l2_critical_data)} experimental trials remained after all filler trials had been removed from the dataset. Then \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l2_critical_data) - nrow(my_online_l2_critical_correct)} critical items, which received no participant response were removed. Finally, \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l2_critical_correct) - nrow(my_online_l2_under_200)} response under 200 milliseconds and \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l2_under_200) - nrow(my_online_l2_over_1500)} responses over 1500 milliseconds were removed. In total, \Sexpr{nrow(my_online_l2_critical_data) - nrow(my_online_l2_critical_correct) + nrow(my_online_l2_critical_correct) - nrow(my_online_l2_under_200) + nrow(my_online_l2_under_200) - nrow(my_online_l2_over_1500)} trials or \Sexpr{round((nrow(my_online_l2_critical_data) - nrow(my_l2_data)) / nrow(my_online_l2_critical_data)*100,2)}\% of the data were removed leaving \Sexpr{nrow(my_l2_data)} L1 English critical data points to be submitted for analysis.

Each dataset was constructed in the same manner, but analyzed separately. The control group dataset contained all L1 monolingual Spanish speakers and the target group dataset contained all data for L1 English--L2 Spanish speakers. Both datasets were comprised of median reaction times by-participant as a function of three experimental conditions: \emph{Target} (CV or CVC syllable structure), \emph{Matching} (matching: target and word initial syllable matched or mismatching: target and word initial syllable did not match) and \emph{Lexicality} (word: a real word in Spanish or nonword: a nonce word that followed Spanish orthographic rules). Each participant supplied eight separate log transformed median reaction times representing each of the eight experimental conditions. Table \ref{online-part-cond} shows the results for one participant. The control group dataset of L1 Spanish speakers consisted of 
\Sexpr{nrow(online_natives)} 
observations---
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_natives$target_syl_structure))} 
\emph{Target} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_natives$matching))} 
\emph{Matching} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_natives$word_status))} 
\emph{Lexicality} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_natives$partNum))} 
participants, while the target group dataset of L1 English speakers consisted of 
\Sexpr{nrow(online_learners)} 
observations---
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_learners$target_syl_structure))} 
\emph{Target} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_learners$matching))} 
\emph{Matching} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_learners$word_status))} 
\emph{Lexicality} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_learners$partNum))} 
participants. Reaction times were log transformed before running inferential statistics, but raw millisecond reaction times were used for descriptive statistics. As a result, both datasets contained the millisecond and log transformed values that were computed by-participant per each condition. There is only one major difference between the data collected in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} and the experiment for the current chapter. In Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, participants saw a subset of experimental items because a Latin square design was used. However, the Latin square experimental design was not used in the current experiment. Therefore, participants saw and responded to all experimental items---\emph{BA} in \emph{balada, baldosa, balega, balbusa} and \emph{BAL} in \emph{balada, baldosa, balega, balbusa}. All data manipulation and analysis were conducted through the use of R and python scripts available at the project's \href{https://github.com/drakeasberry/Dissertation}{GitHub repository} \parencite{R_Core_Team2020-ib,Van_Rossum2009-eg}.

It is imperative to understand the analysis process used in the current experiment because the interpretation of the data must be read differently than results reported in previous studies. In previous literature, datasets were analyzed through a (2) x (2) ANOVA. The first factor, target syllable structure, contained two levels---CV and CVC. The word-initial syllable structure of the presented word was the second factor and also had two levels of CV and CVC structures. Data in the current experiment was submitted to a (2) x (2) x (2) repeated measures ANOVA because an additional factor of lexical status, which accounted for words versus nonwords. Consistent with previous literature, the factor for target syllable structure contained two levels, CV and CVC. However, the current study utilized a second factor with two levels of matching or mismatching rather than the factor containing CV and CVC word-initial syllable structures. Both of these analyses report the same information. Nonetheless, the visualization of these results look quite different as shown in Figures \ref{plt-crossover-comp} and \ref{plt-parallel-comp}, which show a single simulated dataset analyzed in both manners. Previous literature reported results in terms of a crossover effect which occurred when matching conditions facilitated faster detection times for the target. The visualization of the effect was shown as intersecting lines even though the lines were not required to actually cross over each other in order to find a significant interaction between target syllable structure and word-initial syllable structure. Due to the fact that the current study looked at target syllable structure across matching versus mismatching conditions, intersecting lines---those with different slopes even if they did not actually intersect---were not expected in the data visualization.\ttodo[inline]{mh:to be clear, lines never need intersect for a crossover interaction.\newline da: added in notes about not needing to intersect again to clarify} Rather the visualization for a significant effect through the current analysis would be parallel lines---one representing matching conditions and one representing mismatching conditions---where the matching condition resulted in faster detection times than mismatching one. For a more in-depth discussion of the crossover effect versus the current analysis and comparison plots showing both types of analysis, refer to Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} Section \ref{lab-seg-analysis}. This difference also means that a main effect of \emph{Matching} is the factor that is the most relevant comparison to previous research and no significant interactions are expected. In the event that significant interactions are produced, only those interacting with \emph{Matching} will be further explored in the results section because these are directly related to the research questions of the current study.

The log transformed reaction times for the \Sexpr{length(unique(online_natives$partNum))} L1 Spanish controls were submitted to a (2) x (2) x (2) repeated measures ANOVA with \emph{Lexicality, Target} and \emph{Matching} as factors. The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of \emph{Matching} \emph{F}(
\Sexpr{aov_online_natives$anova_table["matching", "num Df"]},

p < .05 
[\Sexpr{round(aov_online_natives$anova_table["matching", "Pr(>F)"],4)}]. There was also a trending main effect of \emph{Lexicality}, but it failed to reach significance 
\emph{F}(
\Sexpr{aov_online_natives$anova_table["word_status", "num Df"]},
\Sexpr{aov_online_natives$anova_table["word_status", "den Df"]}) =

p > .05 
[\Sexpr{round(aov_online_natives$anova_table["word_status", "Pr(>F)"],4)}]. No statistically significant interactions were found. 


In order to look at main effect of \emph{Matching}, post-hoc analyses were conducted. The dataset was regrouped so that each participant's reaction times were computed based on whether the target sequence they were monitoring for matched or mismatched the word-initial syllable of the word in which they detected the target. The dataset consisted of 
\Sexpr{nrow(online_l1_mat_ag)} 
observations---
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_natives$matching))} 
\emph{Matching} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_natives$partNum))} 
participants. This dataset was then submitted to a t-test, which revealed that the L1 Spanish group generally detected targets in the matching condition, 
M= \Sexpr{round(online_l1_mat_compare["match", "Mean"],2)}, 
SD= \Sexpr{round(online_l1_mat_compare["match", "SD"],2)} 
at 95\% CI 
[\Sexpr{round(online_l1_mat_compare["match", "LL"],3)}, 
\Sexpr{round(online_l1_mat_compare["match", "UL"],3)}], 
faster than targets in the mismatching condition, 
M= \Sexpr{round(online_l1_mat_compare["mismatch", "Mean"],2)}, 
SD= \Sexpr{round(online_l1_mat_compare["mismatch", "SD"],2)} 
[\Sexpr{round(online_l1_mat_compare["mismatch", "LL"],3)}, 
\Sexpr{round(online_l1_mat_compare["mismatch", "UL"],3)}]. 
The mean difference, 
M= \Sexpr{round(abs(online_l1_mat_compare["match", "Mean"] - 
online_l1_mat_compare["mismatch", "Mean"]),2)}, 
revealed a statistical difference in detection times between the two matching conditions, 
\emph{t}(\Sexpr{round(t_online_l1_mat_main$parameter,2)}) = 
\Sexpr{round(t_online_l1_mat_main$statistic,4)}, 
p < \Sexpr{round(t_online_l1_mat_main$p.value,4)}.
The main effect of the matching condition was of a 
\Sexpr{online_l1_mat_efsize$magnitude} 
magnitude. This can be seen in the output of Cohen's \emph{d} for \emph{Matching} \emph{d}=

Figure \ref{plt-online-l1-tar-mat-ns-int} shows the data plotted by lexicality with each panel showing the interaction between target syllable structure and matching condition. Note that the parallel lines shown in the word panel of the plot revealed the type of pattern expected to be seen given the way the data was analyzed in the current study. The results showed evidence that L1 Spanish speaking controls used a syllabic segmentation strategy.

\subsection{L1 English Group}
For the \Sexpr{length(unique(online_learners$partNum))} L1 English speakers, the log transformed reaction times were submitted to a (2) x (2) x (2) repeated measures ANOVA with \emph{Target, Matching} and \emph{Lexicality} as factors. The ANOVA revealed no statistically significant main effects, but did reveal a trending main effect of \emph{Matching},

p > .05 
[\Sexpr{round(aov_online_learners$anova_table["matching", "Pr(>F)"],4)}].
There were two two-way significant interactions for the L1 English group. The first was a statistically significant interaction between \emph{Target} and \emph{Matching},
\emph{F}(
\Sexpr{aov_online_learners$anova_table["target_syl_structure:matching", "num Df"]},

p < .05 [0.0000].
%[\Sexpr{round(aov_online_learners$anova_table["target_syl_structure:matching", "Pr(>F)"],4)}] 
and the second was between \emph{Target} and \emph{Lexicality},
\emph{F}(
\Sexpr{aov_online_learners$anova_table["target_syl_structure:word_status", "num Df"]},
\Sexpr{aov_online_learners$anova_table["target_syl_structure:word_status", "den Df"]}) =

p < .05 
[\Sexpr{round(aov_online_learners$anova_table["target_syl_structure:word_status", "Pr(>F)"],4)}]. 
In addition, there was trending interaction between \emph{Matching} and \emph{Lexicality} that failed to reach significance,
\emph{F}(
\Sexpr{aov_online_learners$anova_table["matching:word_status", "num Df"]},
\Sexpr{aov_online_learners$anova_table["matching:word_status", "den Df"]}) =

As done with L1 Spanish controls, post-hoc analyses were conducted to further explore the trending main effect of \emph{Matching}.

The mean difference,

However, the main effect of matching conditions was of a

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In order to break down the first significant interaction between the \emph{Target} and \emph{Matching} factors, a post-hoc analysis was run. The L1 English dataset was further divided into two dataframes: one contained all responses to CV targets and the other contained all responses to CVC targets. Each dataset consisted of 
\Sexpr{nrow(online_cv_learners)} 
observations---
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_cv_learners$matching))} 
\emph{Matching} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_cv_learners$partNum))}
participants. Both CV and CVC target datasets were then each submitted to a one-tailed t-test since the hypothesis is directional in favor of matching conditions being faster than mismatching conditions. This revealed that the L1 English group detected CV syllables faster in the matching condition, 
M= \Sexpr{round(online_tar_mat_compare["CV-match", "Mean"],2)}, 
SD= \Sexpr{round(online_tar_mat_compare["CV-match", "SD"],2)} 
at 95\% CI 
[\Sexpr{round(online_tar_mat_compare["CV-match", "LL"],3)}, 
\Sexpr{round(online_tar_mat_compare["CV-match", "UL"],3)}], 
than CV syllables detected in the mismatching condition,

[\Sexpr{round(online_tar_mat_compare["CV-mismatch", "LL"],3)}, 
\Sexpr{round(online_tar_mat_compare["CV-mismatch", "UL"],3)}]. 
The mean difference, 
M= \Sexpr{round(abs(online_tar_mat_compare["CV-match", "Mean"] - 
online_tar_mat_compare["CV-mismatch", "Mean"]),2)}, 
revealed a statistically significant difference with regards to the target syllable matching the word initial syllable of the carrier item for CV targets, 
\emph{t}(\Sexpr{round(t_online_l2_cv_mat_int$parameter,2)}) = 
\Sexpr{round(t_online_l2_cv_mat_int$statistic,4)}, 
p < 0.0001 %\Sexpr{round(t_online_l2_cv_mat_int$p.value,4)}.
The effect size of matching condition in the CV target dataset was 
\Sexpr{online_l2_cv_mat_efsize$magnitude}

Figure \ref{plt-online-l2-tar-mat-s-int} plots the estimated marginal means for the interaction between \emph{Target} and \emph{Matching} for L1 English speakers. It shows that this interaction was driven by the fact that participants responded significantly faster to the CV targets in the matching condition.% and CVC targets in the mismatching condition.

Finally, the trending interaction between the \emph{Matching} and \emph{Lexicality} factors was further broken down with a post-hoc analysis. The L1 English dataset was subset into two dataframes: one for real words and one for nonwords. Each dataset consisted of 
\Sexpr{nrow(online_nonwd_learners_mat)} 
observations---
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_nonwd_learners_mat$matching))} 
\emph{Matching} conditions x 
\Sexpr{length(unique(online_nonwd_learners_mat$partNum))}
participants. Both datasets, words and nonwords, were then individually submitted to a one-tailed t-test. This revealed that the L1 English group detected targets faster in nonwords for the matching condition, 
M= \Sexpr{round(online_mat_lex_compare["nonword-match", "Mean"],2)}, 
SD= \Sexpr{round(online_mat_lex_compare["nonword-match", "SD"],2)}

[\Sexpr{round(online_mat_lex_compare["nonword-match", "LL"],3)}, 
\Sexpr{round(online_mat_lex_compare["nonword-match", "UL"],3)}], 
than targets detected in the mismatching condition, 
M= \Sexpr{round(online_mat_lex_compare["nonword-mismatch", "Mean"],2)}, 
SD= \Sexpr{round(online_mat_lex_compare["nonword-mismatch", "SD"],2)} 
[\Sexpr{round(online_mat_lex_compare["nonword-mismatch", "LL"],3)}, 
\Sexpr{round(online_mat_lex_compare["nonword-mismatch", "UL"],3)}]. 
The mean difference, 
M= \Sexpr{round(abs(online_mat_lex_compare["nonword-match", "Mean"] - 
online_mat_lex_compare["nonword-mismatch", "Mean"]),2)}, 
revealed a statistically significant difference with regards to the target syllable matching the word initial syllable of the carrier item for nonwords, 
\emph{t}(\Sexpr{round(t_online_l2_nonwd_mat_int$parameter,2)}) = 
\Sexpr{round(t_online_l2_nonwd_mat_int$statistic,4)}, 
p < \Sexpr{round(t_online_l2_nonwd_mat_int$p.value,4)}. 
The effect size of the matching condition in the nonword dataset was 
\Sexpr{online_l2_nonwd_mat_efsize$magnitude} 
in magnitude, \emph{d}= 
\Sexpr{round(online_l2_nonwd_mat_efsize$estimate,2)},

\Sexpr{round(online_l2_nonwd_mat_efsize$conf.int[2],2)}]. 
However, the real word dataset did not reveal the same effect. The L1 English group did not detect targets significantly faster for the matching condition, 
M= \Sexpr{round(online_mat_lex_compare["word-match", "Mean"],2)}, 
SD= \Sexpr{round(online_mat_lex_compare["word-match", "SD"],2)}

The mean difference, 
M= \Sexpr{round(abs(online_mat_lex_compare["word-match", "Mean"] -

revealed no statistical difference with regards to the target syllable matching the word initial syllable of the carrier item for words,

\Sexpr{round(t_online_l2_wd_mat_int$statistic,4)},

The effect size of the matching condition in the word dataset was also

Figure \ref{plt-online-l2-mat-lex-ns-int} plots the estimated marginal means for the interaction between \emph{Matching} and \emph{Lexicality} for L1 English speakers. It shows that the trending interaction was due to the fact that participants responded significantly faster to the matching condition than the mismatching condition, but only for nonwords.

\section{Discussion}
This chapter reported on the \Sexpr{length(unique(my_l2_data$partNum)) + length(unique(my_l1_data$partNum))} participants who completed an online visual Spanish letter sequence monitoring experiment. The current chapter utilized \Sexpr{length(unique(my_l1_data$partNum))} L1 Spanish speakers and \Sexpr{length(unique(my_l2_data$partNum))} L1 English speakers. The experiment run in this chapter attempted to replicate the findings of previous research in terms of Spanish letter sequence monitoring abilities as an indicator of the use of a syllabic segmentation strategy. It continued to investigate the use of the letter sequence monitoring experimental design in order to address whether or not utilizing a syllabic segmentation strategy when processing Spanish was learnable by L1 English speakers. Crucially, it also attempted to investigate and determine why null effects were found in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} of the current dissertation by removing the Latin square experimental design and utilizing monolingual Spanish speakers as the control group instead of L1 Spanish--L2 English bilinguals. 


\subsection{L1 Spanish Speakers}
The outcomes of the L1 Spanish speaker control group in the current chapter replicated the results of \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}, which had also utilized L1 Spanish monolinguals. The findings were in line with this study's hypothesis that L1 Spanish speakers would be sensitive to syllable structure of target and initial syllable of the word containing it. The results supported the use of the syllabic segmentation strategy when processing Spanish by L1 Spanish speakers. Given that the L1 Spanish group showed sensitivity to the syllable during language segmentation, this finding may support the reality of the null effect found in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} and the previous Spanish--English bilingual results \parencite{Bradley1993-qq}. The combined results of the current study and those of Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} suggests that changes in Spanish word segmentation processing strategies are occurring when L1 Spanish speakers acquire English as a second language. However, the study population was not the only variable that was changed for this study. Conducting the experiment online or not using a Latin square design could also be contributing to the findings with L1 Spanish speakers. Nonetheless, this finding is not unlike those previously found for other romance languages such as French where monolinguals and bilinguals differed in their segmentation strategies \parencite{Cutler1992-qq}. They were able to show that French-dominant bilinguals were able to use the syllabic strategy when monitoring in French and inhibit it when monitoring in English while French monolinguals consistently used the strategy in both language monitoring experiments. %This study was not able to tease apart these differences because an English version of the monitoring experiments were not implemented in the current project. 
French and Spanish are similar in terms of syllable structures and lack of ambisyllabicity. It might be expected that Spanish monolinguals could mirror the French results and support the syllabic-based segmentation strategies in English as well, but this was beyond scope of the current study.

In addition to the support of syllabic segmentation strategies for Spanish, these results may also eliminate two other experimental variables that could have masked the effect in previous findings. The first is the selection of Spanish experimental items. Given that participants in both Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} and the current experiment saw the same experimental stimuli, it would suggest that this was not a variable contributing to capturing the syllabic effect or not. If the null result in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} had stemmed from experimental item selection, then it would have been expected that the L1 Spanish group in the current experiment would have produced null results as well. However, that was not the case for the L1 Spanish group in the current chapter as they did utilize a syllable-based segmentation strategy. The second suggests that using a visual experimental design to study phonological processes utilized in segmentation strategies may be a viable option. As in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, the use of visual word recognition paradigm to study segmentation strategies remained a major design difference compared to the previous auditory-based studies. The current study assumed the visual input was activating phonological representations, which came auditory-based studies inherently have since their participants are interpreting the sound bits presented to them. The advantage of using a completely visual design is that it eliminated the possibility of phonetic detail affecting results. Low-level phonetic detail encoded in auditory targets and stimuli had been a potential confound in previous studies. Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} used a visual monitoring experiment and replicated the null effect of a Spanish--English bilingual auditory monitoring experiment from \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}. A second auditory monitoring experiment using Spanish monolinguals in \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} was successfully replicated in the current study. In both cases, the monolingual Spanish speakers did show evidence of a syllabic segmentation strategy while L1 Spanish--L2 English bilinguals did not. These replication studies from auditory to visual experimental designs suggests that representations of syllables are being activated at some level of processing during the visual letter sequence monitoring task as they were in the auditory designs of \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}.

\subsection{L1 English Speakers}
Given the background that L1 Spanish speakers showed evidence of the syllabic segmentation effect, attention is turned to L1 English speakers---the target group in the current study. Previous literature has suggested that English speakers are unable to employ syllabic segmentation strategies even under optimal conditions where monitored languages had been shown to support the strategy \parencite{Bradley1993-qq,Cutler1986-zl,Cutler1992-qq}. The findings of Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} also supported this claim and served as the basis for the current hypothesis that L1 English participants would not exhibit evidence of the syllable-based segmentation strategy. Therefore, it was quite surprising that a trend was found for the target group, which may suggest some sensitivity to the syllable during Spanish word segmentation. This sensitivity to the matching condition was driven by the nonwords utilized in the study. When initial syllables of nonwords matched the syllable structure of the target, they were detected faster than nonwords with initial syllable that mismatched the target syllable structure. While only a trend was found, this suggests that syllabic segmentation may be learnable by L1 speakers of English. Despite the fact that all previous studies have shown that the acquisition of English has blocked or altered the use of a syllabic-based segmentation strategy, the results here are the first to suggest that this may not actually be the case. 

In addition to the trending main effect of \emph{Matching}, there were also significant interactions that warrant further discussion. In Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}, participants showed a preference of monitoring for CVC target sequences over CV ones, but this was not true of the findings in the current experiment. In the current chapter, no reaction time advantage was revealed for either target structure---CV or CVC. However, the \emph{Target} factor was involved in a significant interaction---\emph{Target and Matching}---where \emph{Matching} was the most relevant factor to the current study. The target syllable structure that participants were monitoring for was interacting with the matching condition. The \emph{Matching} condition was the factor that the main hypothesis revolved around. When monitoring for CV targets, the participants were much faster to detect to the target when the word-initial syllable structure matched than when it mismatched. This actually went against the hypothesis that L1 English speakers would not be sensitive to this matching condition. However, this sensitivity did not carry over to the the CVC target. These results may indicate that the participants were making decisions when monitoring based off a partial match such as the CV portion of target. Therefore, they may have been matching the letter strings based on the first two segments rather than processing all three segments of the target. This would lead to a naturally faster detection time since participants would be processing the stimuli from left to right. This would also be inline with an orthographic serial processing model that would not rely on phonological activation. Given that support for phonological activation was found in the visual stimuli for L1 Spanish speakers, a serial approach does not appear to explain the whole story. It is more likely that a phonological condition such as ambisyllabicity forced L1 English participants to differ on the matching condition for the CVC targets. For example, when participants monitored for the target \emph{BAL}, they detected it faster in \emph{balada} than in \emph{baldosa}. Since ambisyllabicity is not present in Spanish, L1 Spanish speakers would converge on only one syllabification pattern for \emph{balada}, which would be \emph{ba.la.da}. Unlike Spanish, English allows for ambisyllabicity giving multiple acceptable syllabification options for the L1 English speakers monitoring for this type of stimuli. The first is that they would syllabify in a similar manner as the L1 Spanish group. In this case, it would have been expected to find overall main effect for the \emph{Matching} condition as found for the L1 Spanish group. However, another candidate exists for L1 English speakers where the /l/ is brought into the coda position for the word initial syllable and remains in the onset of the second syllable---i.e. \emph{bal.la.da}. If this were the case, then finding the target \emph{BAL} is now a matching condition instead of a mismatching condition in the word \emph{balada}. CV targets had been shown to elicit faster detection times for the L1 English group when they matched versus when they mismatched. Therefore, the L1 English syllabification differed from the L1 Spanish syllabification for CV stimuli where ambisyllabicity could occur. This created faster detection times for CV stimuli because they were scored against the L1 Spanish CV syllabic intuitions. This would also be strong evidence that phonological representations were being activated. It would also suggest that their L1 segmentation strategies and syllable intuitions were at play when processing their L2 Spanish. The CVC targets should not be susceptible to this ambisyllabic effect because in all cases the medial consonant cluster would need to be split according to both Spanish and English phonotactics. Nonetheless, when the target was a CVC and a word such as \emph{balada} was the carrier, ambisyllabic response should be faster even though it mismatches. These two factors combined could be responsible for the interaction where mismatching CV targets are slower and CVC mismatching targets are faster.


\subsection{Experimental Design Modifications}
Turning from the main results of the experimental control and target groups, the discussion now looks more in-depth at some of the experimental design changes. The first major change is the completely visual design used in the current study as compared to completely auditory or mixed design experiments conducted in previous literature. This was a variable that was not changed between Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} and the current study because one of the main research questions for this dissertation was whether or not the phonological processes involved in syllable-based word segmentation could be captured through a visual experimental methodology. The findings of the current study suggest that this is an option for experimental designs. Since the study revolves around the phonological syllable formed by the participant from the visual target presentation, it suggests that visual targets and words are activating the phonological representation at some level. Further support comes from the replication of the auditory design with L1 Spanish speaker in \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} with a visual design with L1 Spanish speakers in the current study. \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} reported that written targets produced slower responses than spoken targets---618 ms versus 583 ms. %\ttodo[inline]{da: page 209 is reference page to information} 
They argued that the spoken target presentation limited variability and aided the participants in the segmentation task. The L1 Spanish results in the current study had an average reaction time of 
\Sexpr{round(mean(online_l1_wd_av$segRespRTmsec_Mean),0)} 
ms for words, which supported their claim. Only the average for words can be compared here because \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} did not include nonwords their study. Nonetheless the average response time for nonwords in the current study was 
\Sexpr{round(mean(online_l1_nonwd_av$segRespRTmsec_Mean),0)} 
ms. Indeed, these results were in line with slower reaction times for visual targets that would have been predicted following the findings of \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}. While the results here did not show conclusive evidence for L1 English speakers, the L1 Spanish speakers did exhibit the expected syllabic effect. These results reflect the predictions that were made based on the assumptions developed from previous research that have shown a connection between reading and phonological activation.

A full discussion related to reaction times is warranted because they have been shown to be a crucial factor for supporting evidence of syllabic segmentation strategy in previous Spanish monitoring experiments. Very fast reaction times have been argued to mask the effect while slowing participant responses have been argued to cause the effect to reemerge. For example, \textcite{Sebastian-Galles1992-xd} increased their average reaction times for monitoring in Spanish from 355-394 ms where they found no effect to 586-643 ms by adding a semantic relationship task to their design. The syllabic effect reemerged for them once they had successfully slowed the response times of participants with the added semantic relationship task. Similarly, \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} found a syllabic effect in their Spanish monolingual participants with reaction times ranging from 556-609 ms, but not with their bilingual speakers who had reaction times ranging from 469-524 ms. In Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} of this dissertation, the reaction times of L1 Spanish--L2 English speakers ranged from 
\Sexpr{round(min(lab_l1_wd_av$segRespRTmsec_Mean),0)}-\Sexpr{round(max(lab_l1_wd_av$segRespRTmsec_Mean),0)}
ms and L1 English--L2 Spanish speakers ranged from 
\Sexpr{round(min(lab_l2_wd_av$segRespRTmsec_Mean),0)}-\Sexpr{round(max(lab_l2_wd_av$segRespRTmsec_Mean),0)}
ms for real words. The previous results of this dissertation also did not find evidence of a syllabic segmentation strategy. The current chapter saw reaction times ranging from 
\Sexpr{round(min(online_l1_wd_av$segRespRTmsec_Mean),0)}-\Sexpr{round(max(online_l1_wd_av$segRespRTmsec_Mean),0)} 
ms for L1 Spanish and from 
\Sexpr{round(min(online_l2_wd_av$segRespRTmsec_Mean),0)}-\Sexpr{round(max(online_l2_wd_av$segRespRTmsec_Mean),0)} 
ms for L1 English speakers for real words. \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} argued that the pre-lexical claim in French given by \textcite{Mehler1981-vi} was not upheld in Spanish because of their much longer reaction times compared to the French reactions times ranging from 352-378 ms that did produce a syllabic effect. However, a Dutch study showed sensitivity to syllable-based segmentation strategy for clear syllable boundaries with average response times around 600 ms. They cross-spliced the initial syllable of stimuli, which aligned with CV and CVC syllable structures. The syllable cut from the CV initial syllable word was then attached to the remainder of the CVC initial syllable word and vice versa. Their findings followed the signal meaning that they found sensitivity to syllable structure when it was using real Dutch words and Dutch nonwords created from the cross-splicing word-initial syllables. This was used as evidence that slow response times do not necessarily rule out pre-lexical decisions or codes \parencite[Zwitserlood, 1991 as cited in][]{Bradley1993-qq}. The use of nonword condition in the current study allowed for a similar comparison to be made within the same speaker. Given the similar reaction time averages for words and nonwords in the current study, pre-lexical decisions cannot be ruled even though the reactions times are much longer than in previous studies as can be seen in Table \ref{tab-lab-online-mean-rt}.

\label{tab-lab-online-mean-rt}
\end{table}

A final point that Table \ref{tab-lab-online-mean-rt} highlights is the difference between reaction times recorded in in-person experiments versus those recorded in online experiments. The average reactions times from Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} were comparable to \textcite{Bradley1993-qq} average reaction times, but that is not the case with the reaction times that were recorded in the current online experiments. The patterns for average reaction times remained the same in that L1 English speakers tended to respond faster than L1 Spanish speakers and both groups tended to respond faster to words than nonwords. The online experiment averages increased by 141 ms for English word averages, 144 for English nonword averages, 191 ms for Spanish word averages and 203 ms for Spanish nonword averages. It was noted in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} that the visual target and stimuli presentation may have accounted for slightly longer reaction times in comparison to \textcite{Bradley1993-qq}. This effect was expected to occur in the current experimental design as the same stimuli and completely visual presentation was retained in the online experiment. Therefore, the increase in average reaction times between the current findings and those in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} are likely to be related to online method of experimentation. When running experiments online, the researcher lacks the ability to control types of hardware and software configurations as well as amount of latency introduced due to internet connectivity. While these results definitely vary between the lab and online environments, new research is showing that technology is advancing to the point that similar results for visual-based reaction time studies can be obtained \parencite{Bridges2020-el,Plant2016-nv}. Despite the fact that many of these online experiment limitations existed for the current chapter, significant results were obtained. Moreover, this finding also supported the viability of conducting a sufficiently powered phonological study where reaction time was crucial to the interpretation of the results in an online environment without a specialized button response box. The current study met its precalculated power with sample sizes of 
\Sexpr{online_grp_desc["Monolingual Spanish","n"]} 
participants from Spanish and 
\Sexpr{online_grp_desc["L2 Learner","n"]} 
from English. Even though the study contained sufficient power, the actual effect within this group may larger than what is reported here. This reduction in effect size, if applicable would likely result from other secondary variables at play due to conducting the study online rather than in person.

Lastly, a major design change in experiment settings allowed for additional comparisons within subjects. Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} used of a Latin square design which meant a within subjects comparison for target pairing was not available for analysis. This resulted from the mixed design of words and nonwords. In order to compare \emph{ba} and \emph{bal} in a real word condition, only a between subjects analysis could be used because no participant saw the targets \emph{ba} and \emph{bal} in the same lexicality condition---word or nonword. Under the previous design, \emph{ba} with a real word could only be compared to the same participant's response to \emph{bal} with a nonword. In the current chapter, the Latin square design was removed, which meant the \emph{ba} and \emph{bal} could be compared within the same participant for both word and nonword stimuli. This was true because the new design presented all conditions to every participant. For example, find \emph{ba} in \emph{balada} 'ballad', find \emph{ba} in \emph{balega} 'nonword', find \emph{bal} in \emph{baldosa} 'tile' and find \emph{bal} in \emph{balbusa} 'nonword'. It could be argued that removing the Latin square design could have introduced differences in reaction times due to repetition of stimuli to same participant. If this were to have had an effect, it would be expected that it would have decreased reaction times. As can be seen in the discussion above on reaction times, this was not the case. Reaction times actually increased in the online environment but in a systematic pattern causing average reaction times to mimic the results in the in-person experiments from Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}.

\ttodo[inline]{ms: Expand this last part to include visual replication and L2 directional trend or learnability being restricted to CV and not CVC. The interactions found in the L1 English group and not in the L1 Spanish group may indicate some fundamental difference between the two groups.\newline da: revised to expand on details as discussed}

This chapter concludes with results that support a syllable-based segmentation strategy for Spanish. The results indicated that it was possible to see evidence of the syllabic segmentation strategy in a L1 Spanish monolingual group. It also suggests that this strategy may be learnable by L1 English speakers who are second language learners of Spanish. However, the results do differ between groups in potentially interesting manners. The L1 Spanish group produced results that the main hypothesis predicted and the matching condition did not interact with any other variable. On the other hand, The L1 English groups seemed to be aligning with the patterns of the L1 Spanish group in terms of the matching condition. Where they differed was in the interactions that the matching condition was involved in. This may be linked to underlying fundamental L1 differences of ambisyllabicity that occurs in English, but not in Spanish. In addition, these results provided evidence that this syllabic segmentation effect could be captured through a completely visual experimental design. Up to this point, all previous research on syllable-based segmentation had contained some auditory component. When auditory components are part of the design, the activation of phonology is inherent to its design because participants must decode the speech input. However, the current study has replicated the findings of a Spanish auditory study through a completely visual methodology that had to assume reading actually activated these same phonological representations. This opens up the door for future studies to utilize a visual-based methodology to study phonological processes. Lastly, it suggests that investigating these segmentation strategies and/or other reaction time studies are becoming increasingly viable through online experimental platforms.
