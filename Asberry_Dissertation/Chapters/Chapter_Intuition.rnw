\section{Introduction}
%\ttodo[inline]{As explained last time, I believe the first six pages are unnecessary. The content is vague, too broad, and leads nowhere. Cut it in less than half and focus on things that are directly relevant to the research presented in this chapter: what is this study about, what is the general research question, why is it being conducted---what is the motivation, what is the immediate context for the research question, what are the predictions. Your study is about syllabic intuitions and about syllabic intuitions only. Do not discuss literature that is not directly relevant. This must funnel faster or start less broad. The introduction lacks focus and structure. Why am I telling the reader about this? Shoot for about 3-4 pages with about 5 paragraphs.}

All languages consist of a set of specific patterns in terms of vocabulary, syntax and phonology that are adopted or accepted by its speakers. Native speakers naturally develop an understanding of these concepts from the environment around them as their language develops. Second language learners can implicitly gain knowledge about the language they are learning, but are also generally taught explicitly through classroom instruction as well. These differences in learning can affect the way a person is able to use the language at a later stage of acquisition. All language learners begin building a vocabulary or set of words in the language that can be used to convey meaning. %Language users create utterances with their vocabulary according to the accepted rules of the language. Languages have grammars which are language specific. These grammars inform users on how to use the language for things such as expressing past, present and future or what order to put words so that utterances are acceptable by native speakers. A clear example is phrase word order that differs with adjective placement between English and Spanish. In Spanish, \emph{una bolsa azul} 'a bag blue' when translated word by word; however, a better translation of the phrase would be 'a blue bag'. This difference arises between the two languages because Spanish prescribes the adjective to follow the noun it describes while English prescribes that adjective precede the noun. Words, like language word order, also possess a specific structures. 
The main focus of this chapter is what underlies the word structure used to create these words in a given language. 
%While the discussions below the word-level can include units such as phonemes and moras, this study focuses on the syllabic structure of words \parencite{Cutler1994-qg,Cutler2002-ty,Kim2008-qc,Labrune2012-lh,Nazzi1998-zc,Otake1993-kd,Pierrehumbert1995-jr,Tranel1991-oa}.
The discussion revolves around syllables because permissible syllable structures differ between English and Spanish. These differences in syllable structure have potential side effects for the L1 Spanish and L1 English speakers when performing tasks such as word segmentation or accessing their mental lexicons when processing Spanish. Therefore, this chapter sought to understand and document differences in syllabic intuition through the use of a two-alternate forced choice task where participants had to choose between two options for the word-initial syllable of Spanish words.

In order to understand why differences may exist, a look at sub-syllabic units is necessary. Syllables can be further broken down systematically into its individual phonemes, or individual sound segments. It is important to define a few crucial terms before the current discussion on syllable structure and its effect on other language processes. The internal structure of a syllable is made up of phonemes which combine to form the onset, nucleus and coda of syllables. The onset of the syllable is a consonant or a consonant cluster that occurs before the nucleus and the coda is a consonant or a consonant cluster occurring after the nucleus. The nucleus is the center and most sonorant portion of the syllable, which is typically realized as a vowel. The rime of a syllable is simply the combination of the nucleus and coda. However, acceptable syllable structures or the phoneme combinations that can form a syllable's sub-units are not language specific. For instance, what phonemes and the max allowable number of phonemes that can combine to create onsets, nuclei and codas differ between languages. Where these differences occur are areas where it might be expected to see learner difficulties. Syllable formations becomes a crucial factor to this because the L1 background of the control group is Spanish while the target group is English. This will have implications for where each group will divide words into individual syllables. Therefore, this experiment is gaining an understanding of the control group's native syllable intuition and comparing it to the second language syllable intuitions of the target group. 

Now, the discussion turns to the acquisition processes of these linguistic units because they are directly related to L1 and L2 backgrounds of the participants. While this study incorporates L1 speaker controls, the main goal of this study is how second language learners of Spanish process their L2. The first major difference in native speakers and second language learners is the state of the language faculty at the onset of acquisition. For a native speaker, the infant is essentially starting with a blank template. In fact, infants generally go from having the ability to discriminate between ambiguous sounds whether or not they are related to their native language needs during the first year of life. Over the course of the first year they begin to narrow down their perceptual range of sound discriminatory abilities \parencite{Bosch2003-jm,Byers-Heinlein2010-fv,Shafer2011-mv,Sundara2008-tc}. This perceptual narrowing suggests that infants begin to ignore sound discriminations that are not useful to processing their native language and paying more attention to those sound discriminations that do make a difference. %The literature on infants are using sound discriminations to show how these eventually become part of the phonemic inventory of the language. What constitutes a phoneme in a given language is determined by two sound segments being in contrastive distribution, which occurs when two segments occur in the same phonological context and spur a change in meaning. A minimal pair test is commonly used to support the existence of two separate phonemes in a language. The minimal pair test utilizes two words with different meanings and exactly one phoneme difference between the two. For example, /b\ae t/ 'bat' and /b\ae g/ 'bag' share phonemes in the onset and nucleus, but the singleton coda phoneme differs. Given that the single phonemic difference in the coda position changes the meaning of the word, it can be argued that /t/ and /g/ are two distinct phonemes of English. 
All infants learning their native language will eventually distinguish between sounds according to phonemic inventories of the language they are acquiring. They will also learn how to combine these phonemes into acceptable syllable and words that conform to the phonotactic properties of their L1. %It is important to note that not all phonemes exist in all languages and even when two languages do contain the same phonemes, the properties of those phonemes can have different phonetic properties. To illustrate this point, the phonemes /p/ and /b/ will be exemplified in Arabic, English and Spanish. English and Spanish infants would encounter processing issues if they lost the distinction between these two phonemes because they are contrastive in the language, but an infant learning Arabic would not be faced with the same disadvantage because these two phonemes are not contrastive. The minimal pair test with \emph{pig} and \emph{big} in English or \emph{bala} 'bullet' and \emph{pala} 'shovel' in Spanish, differ only in the distinction between phonemes /p/ and /b/ in the word-initial onset positions. This supports the claim that /p/ and /b/ are distinct phonemes because they are in contrastive distribution in both English and Spanish. However, minimal pairs for /p/ and /b/ cannot be found in Arabic due to the fact the /p/ is not a sound found the phonemic inventory. As a result, it makes no difference to the Arabic learning infant if they discriminate between the two sounds. To sum up, it is important for English and Spanish infants to develop two separate phonological categories for /p/ and /b/ to process their L1 language, while retaining these two separate categories for Arabic infants would provide no processing advantage.
On the other hand, second language learners do not have a clean slate to build their target language on. This adds another layer of complexity to the task of acquiring second language phonological system because their L2 phonology will be filtered through their L1 phonological system. In this case, the second language learner already has their L1 language system in place, complete with its vocabulary, syntax, phonology and all the nuances that accompany these systems. %In terms of phonolgical categories, this results in two possible outcomes. In the case of the Arabic native speaker, they are confronted with a sound distinction they learned to ignore when they attempt to learn English or Spanish. This problem surfaces in both perception and production as they cannot hear the difference between /p/ and /b/ nor can they produce these sounds accurately. This is a case where the L1 Arabic speaker needs to learn a new phonemic distinction and create a new phonological category for their L2 that is absent from their L1 phonology system. %\ttodo[inline]{reference} 
%Turning towards the other two language groups, English and Spanish, it is possible to see that there are similar difficulties faced by second language learners even when the L1 is also English or Spanish. Even though both Spanish and English have a distinction between /p/ and /b/, they are phonetically realized differently in terms of voice onset timing (VOT). VOT is the measure of time between release of an air burst from a stop consonant and the start of the vocal chords beginning to vibrate indicating voicing. These phonemes are realized differently depending on the language environment in which the infant is living---English or Spanish speaking. %\ttodo[inline]{This is a great place to define and distinguish between phonology and phonetics.} 
%Thus the existing phonological categories for the L1 and L2 overlap but map to a different phoneme. For example, \textcite{Lisker1964-le} found a Spanish /b/ has a VOT of -138ms and a Spanish /p/ has a VOT of 4ms. For English, they found a VOT of 1 for /b/ and 58 for /p/. Therefore, when a Spanish speaker is listening to English, it is easy to see how the English /b/ is phonetically realized as a /p/ due to the similarities of VOT in the two sounds. Likewise, when an English speaker is listening to Spanish, the /p/ can easily be confused with the English /b/ for the same reason. VOT is just one example variable that show the trouble second language learners may encounter due to the transference of L1 phonology to the L2 phonology. 
Due to these two interacting language systems, interference can occur. L1 interference is where some aspect of the L1 affects the language use of the L2. This is widely documented for a multitude of linguistic variables in second language acquisition literature.  

%To a lesser extent L2 to L1 interference also been reported, which is where the L2 actually modifies some aspect of the person's L1. 

A common example that illustrates this is L1 Spanish speaker's pronunciation of the English word \emph{Spain} as a two syllable word, /\textschwa s.peIn/, in order to align with Spanish phonotactics. Likewise, L1 English speakers do not recognize that onsets are more restrictive in Spanish and produce L2 Spanish words according to their L1 English phonology. L2 Spanish speakers will often produce \emph{in.struc.tor} rather than the native accepted pronunciation of \emph{ins.truc.tor} because a complex onset of /str/ is acceptable in their L1 English. Another relevant example for the L1 English-L2 Spanish speaker is the intervocalic consonants /r/ and /l/. The Spanish word \emph{para} can be syllabified by L1 English speakers as \emph{par.ra} or \emph{pa.ra}. This later example is due to ambisyllabicity, which allows for a single phoneme to be present in the coda of the first syllable and the onset of the second syllable. Ambisyllabicity effectively blurs the syllable boundary and is found in English, but not in Spanish. Therefore, when L1 English speakers transfer these phonological properties to their L2 Spanish, they create syllable boundaries that differ from Spanish native-like norms. These difference can and need to be investigated so that there is better understanding about how they may affect experimental designs and other language processes such as word segmentation or lexical access. As a result, the current study utilizes a two-alternative forced choice task to gather the syllabic intuitions of L1 Spanish and L1 English speakers. It is expected that L1 English speakers will have less consistent syllabic intuitions patterns in Spanish than the L1 Spanish speakers. If Spanish syllabic intuitions differ between the L1 Spanish and L1 English speakers it may predict differences in word segmentation strategies that are tested in Chapters \ref{ch-seg-lab} and \ref{ch-seg-online}.

%\ttodo[inline]{Give the background for studying syllabic intuitions. Treiman Haulde I think. There are direct elicitation and children games, etc. You also see effects of this in second language production eSpain.}

\section{Background}
%\ttodo[inline]{I have also had a very hard time following the thread in section 3.2 (Background). You discuss in too much detail some studies by Treiman and colleagues. While this literature is certainly very relevant, I don't see why the reader needs so much detail. Your goals here are: 1) establish that people have intuitions about syllable structure (Treiman's studies suffice to show this: only after you say this explicitly can you say they have intuitions about subcomponents of the syllable, like the onset and the rime, not before!; but, in my opinion, the French studies are much better at showing this directly; then you can move on to the English studies by Treiman.); 2) establish that Spanish and English have different syllable structures: analyze in some detail (your current comparison has it's own section, yet the actual discussion of the facts is shallow and extremely brief: how to the two languages differ? Give examples, provide tables, do a simple phonological analysis! 3) explain clearly that Spanish and English differn in the phenomenon of ambisyllabicity (your question is exclusively about ambisyllabicity, yet you never say it and never explain what it is), etc. Your Introduction does not contain a real research question, and there is no operationalized research question either. The study is not motivated nor justified, and the reader is not sure what you're asking and what you're expecting to find. This is important: the text needs to have a list of clear, motivated predictions.}


%\subsection{Spanish and English Syllable Structure}
There are many similarities and differences in syllable properties between Spanish and English. In terms of vowel reduction, English readily allows vowel reduction to a schwa in unstressed syllables while Spanish does not allow for vowel reduction at all. While Spanish has very clear syllable boundaries, English allows for ambisyllabicity where one phoneme is shared between two adjacent syllables. Internal to the syllable structure, the phonemes that can combine to form the onset differ between the two languages as well. According to \textcite{Harris1983-vu} onsets can only have up to two segments and the consonants that can fill onset slots are highly restricted in Spanish. In a complex onset, the first segment must be an obstruent and the second segment can only be a liquid while any consonant will suffice in a single segment onset. However, English permits up to three segments in the onset position as shown by words such as \emph{street} and \emph{spring}. Similar differences in complexity are found in English and Spanish codas. English codas frequently contain two phonemes with the possibility of four phonemes in words such as [sIks\texttheta s] 'sixths'. On the other hand, complex codas are not common at all in Spanish \parencite{Whitley1986-nc}. When complex codas do occur in Spanish, the second phoneme is an /s/ as in the word \emph{ins-ti-tu-to} 'institute'. \textcite{Harris1983-vu} claims that Spanish syllables can have maximally five segments as in the first syllable of \emph{claustro} [kláws-tro] 'cloister'. This maximal five segment syllable length is a shorter than can be found in English words such as \emph{strengths} [st\textturnr \textepsilon \textipa{N}k\texttheta s], which contains eight segments. These differences in syllable properties will likely affect how L1 English and L1 Spanish speakers process syllables and words when segmenting speech in the two languages.
%\ttodo[inline]{This section needs to focus on ambisyllabicity from a phonology-based perspective. No experimental data needed in this section.}

From a phonology-based perspective, these abstract concepts of phonemes and syllables structures---onsets, nuclei, codas, rimes---had been created by linguists in order to explain language grammars and phonological processes that can been seen in everyday language use. %Since phonemes combine to build syllables, the focus of the current study, it would be expected that these difficulties could extend to syllable structures as well. 
In instances where L1 and L2 phonological systems differ is where the evidence of this transfer becomes very salient in phonetics. For example, legal combinations of phonemes in the onset of the L1 may be illegal combinations in the L2 or vice versa. Using the onset position of English and Spanish syllables, it is possible to see why certain combinations cause L2 learners trouble. While English allows onsets such as /sp(r), st(r), sk, sl/, Spanish does not allow these combinations of phonemes in the onset position. %\ttodo[inline]{is this list exhaustive? Check out phonology notes from Colina} 
Spanish speakers attempt to overcome this obstacle in their L2 English by inserting an epenthetic /\textschwa/ to pull the /s/ into the coda position of the first syllable and the remaining consonants remain in the onset of the second syllable. This breaks up the illegal consonant cluster and the English word now conforms to the constraints of their L1 Spanish phonology. A common example that illustrates this is the English word \emph{Spain}. Since /sp/ is an illegal onset in Spanish, an L1 Spanish speaker will commonly produce a two syllable word, /\textschwa s.peIn/, in order to align with Spanish phonotactics. Likewise, English speakers do not recognize that these complex onsets are illegal in Spanish and produce words according to their L1 English phonology creating syllable boundaries that differ from Spanish native-like norms. L2 Spanish speakers will often produce \emph{in.struc.tor} rather than the native Spanish accepted pronunciation of \emph{ins.truc.tor} because an onset of /str/ is acceptable in their L1 English. 

A second major difference between English and Spanish is ambisyllabicity.%, which refers to a single phoneme being part of two separate syllables in the word. 
To place this into context, \emph{balada} 'ballad' and \emph{baldosa} 'tile' will be used illustrate how ambisyllabicity functions. Ambisyllabicity is not present in Spanish; therefore, L1 Spanish speakers would converge on only one syllabification pattern---\emph{ba.la.da} and \emph{bal.do.sa}. In contrast to very clear Spanish syllable boundaries, English allows for ambisyllabicity, which blur English syllable boundary in certain phonological environments. As a result, ambisyllabicity creates an environment where multiple syllabification options exist for the L1 English speakers in their L2 Spanish. One pattern is syllabifying in the same manner as the L1 Spanish group for both \emph{ba.la.da} and \emph{bal.do.sa}. The second candidate that exists for L1 English speakers causes the intervocalic /l/ to be brought into the coda position for the word initial syllable while it remains in the onset position of the second syllable \emph{bal.la.da}. This effect can be seen in English syllabifications such as \emph{bal.ance} and \emph{bal.lance} for the word \emph{balance}. In the case of \emph{bal.do.sa}, no divergence from the Spanish-like syllabification pattern is expected because /ld/ is not a legal onset in English. Therefore, this is also a very clear syllable for both L1 Spanish and L1 English speakers. These intervocalic liquids, /r/ and /l/, are prime candidates for L1 English to L2 Spanish transfer of ambisyllabicity.

%The study of \textcite{Treiman1983-jr} on ability to learn these rules explicitly were done in four separate sessions in the syllable game. After the fourth session, participants were given the four rules and asked to rank them for naturalness and easiness of learning. \ttodo{did this pattern with the data results from above} Up to this everything studied under the phoneme and syllable blending had been done with nonsense syllables. \textcite{Treiman1986-nh} replicated the novel word games using nonwords in \textcite{Treiman1983-jr} with real word stimuli in a syllable blending task. The findings again gave evidence in support of the onset and rime (Experiments 1 and 2. \textcite{Treiman1986-nh} tested sonority levels \ttodo{sonority principle has not been defined yet} as a factor that could potentially affect how speakers view subsyllabic units. The results again revealed that regardless of the composition of the onset consonant cluster, it was more difficult to split it up than keep it intact (Ex 3). While this finding was interesting in its own right, it is more interesting because participants were asked whether the difference between two syllables were more due to the vowel or consonant in syllable pairs such as /spa/ and /sa/. \ttodo[inline]{This difference is unclear and needs further explanation} There scores indicated that glides such as /w/ was more vowel like than other consonant types like stops, nasals or liquids. Nonetheless the participants still preferred to keep the syllable onset intact when glides were the second consonant of onset for CCV syllables.
%\textcite{Harris1983-vu} claims that Spanish syllables can have maximally five segments. However, not all five segment syllables are well-formed in Spanish. Consider the well-formed word claustro [kláws.tro] and the ill-formed word *[mwers.to]. Notice the initial syllable of both words has five segments. The difference in well-formedness results from the rhyme of claustro only having three segments because the [kl] cluster makes up the onset of the syllable. In the ill-formed word only the [m] is part of the coda, leaving the remaining four segments to be part of the rhyme. By removing the /s/ from the ill-formed word the real Spanish word muerto [mwer.to] is revealed, which is now well-formed because only 3 segment remain in the rhyme—the maximal amount of units allowed in Spanish rhymes. According to \textcite{Hualde1991-sk}, glides can become part of the onset in words such as mayo ´May’ and hielo ‘ice’, [ma.jo] and [je.lo] respectively. However, according to \textcite{Harris1983-vu} onsets can only have up to two segments and the consonants that can fill onset slots are highly restricted in Spanish. In a complex onset, the first segment must be an obstruent and the second segment can only be a liquid while in a single segment onset, any consonant will suffice. Therefore, the semiconsonant [j] can legally fill the onset position of hielo, but [mw] is not an acceptable complex onset of Spanish making mwersto a phonotactically illegal word in Spanish.

%As it has been shown, the glide can be parsed in the syllable structure in both the onset or the rhyme of the Spanish syllable, but what does imply about the syllable structure. \textcite{Hualde1991-sk} suggests that prevocalic glides are part of the syllable nucleus and postvocalic glides are part of the coda. In pienso [pjén.so] ‘I think’, the first syllable onset consists of a single consonant [p], the nucleus [jé] and the coda [n]. In mayo [ma.jo] ‘May’, the second syllable contains an onset [j], nucleus [o] and does not have a coda. Hualde proposes that initially, the glide is parsed as part of the nucleus of the second syllable, then syllabification occurs leaving an onsetless syllable where [j] can now associate since it is in syllable initial position. The final option is for the glide to be assigned to the coda position as it does in the word bojna ‘beret’ [bój.na]. The initial syllable has an onset [b], nuclues [o] and coda [j], which was adjoined after maximizing all onsets in the word, which left [j] unsyllabified following Hualde. These three variations have direct implication for stress placement in Spanish words. \textcite{Harris1983-vu} shows this to be true using te-lé-fo-no ‘telephone’, te-lé-gra-fo ‘telegraph’, *te-lé-fos-no, *te-lé-boj-no, *te-lé-fwe-no and *te-lé-fje-no to illustrate the point. Antepenultimate stress is used in all the examples, which is crucial to the understanding of the no-branching penultimate rhyme solution Harris proposes. The two real words teléfono and telégrafo show that both 2 and 3 segment penultimate syllables are well-formed in the language. Crucially, both of the these words have light penultimate syllables in that rhyme only includes one segment—hence the term no-branching. The first nonword, teléfosno, breaks this no-branching rhyme constraint with the addition of a second segment (the coda [s]) to the rhyme, which creates a CVC syllable. Similarly, the glide parsed in the coda of telébojno creates a CVC penultimate syllable that again creates an ill-formed word. Finally, when the glides are parsed as part of the nucleus, it creates a branching penultimate rhyme even though there are no coda consonants—CVV. Since the onset position is already filled, the environment for the glide to move out of the nucleus into the onset does not exist resulting in the ill-formed word.

\subsection{Experimental Evidence for Syllable Intuitions}
%\ttodo[inline]{You discuss the studies one by one, making no connections across them, just listing, providing tons of details on method. All these studies are on English. Need less information on the Treiman studies, need to make connections, and currently missing the a large component on Spanish syllable structure.}

There is a large amount of research that aimed to gain a better understanding of syllabic intuitions. \textcite{MacKay1972-ii} studied the structure of words and syllables. They analyzed speech errors where people produced an incorrect word stemming from the combination of two real words that have similar meanings. This type of analysis looked at the reasons why a combination of \emph{behavior} and \emph{deportment}, both related to a person's behavior or manners, produced a speech error \emph{behortment}. \textcite{MacKay1972-ii} analyzed synonymic intrusions in German and English resulting in support for the fact that syllables minimally consist of three subunits. They argued that syllables contained individual phonemes, consonant clusters and a sub-syllabic unit that combines a vowel and final consonants. Their sub-syllabic unit is otherwise known as the rime in later literature. Given evidence from both German and English, they argued that this may be a language universal principle. A second common task utilized in this previous research is picture naming \parencite{Ferrand1996-vu,Keffala2018-ta,Olson2013-dy,Schiller1998-ph}. A picture naming task shows the participant a picture and asks them to name what they see in the picture they were shown. This is a way of eliciting words without having the influence of outside phonology or orthography intervene in the production of lexical items. Picture naming allows researcher to collect a large amount of data quickly because researchers have control over their experimental items and designs, which can even include nonwords. These are distinct advantages over the synonymic intrusions which have to be filtered out from large corpora of spoken data containing a lot of noise or unusable data. However, synonymic intrusion does provide natural language data which does mimic the real language use found in day to day environments. While both of these tasks were beneficial to investigating syllable structures, they require a large working vocabulary to analyze real word data. Several other tasks such as phoneme substitution, syllable blending and syllable repetition have been developed to study the internal structure of syllables using experimental methods. These experimental-based studies require less dependency on large working vocabularies and can even utilize nonwords to test syllabic intuitions of a speaker. These are viable options for the current study because its main goal is to understand the syllabic intuitions for L1 Spanish and L1 English speakers have and how they may differ from one another. These syllabic intuitions may have further implications for other phonological processes such as a person's ability to segment words or access the mental lexicon. Much of the previous research stemmed from English studies by Treiman. \textcite{Treiman1983-jr} used experimental methods that attempted to validate the psychological reality of the internal structure of syllables that had been proposed by theoretical phonology. French, like Spanish, is another romance language that does not allow ambisyllabicity. As a result, French and Spanish contrast English in a similar manner. Since Spanish syllabic intuitions have not been studied through experimental means, several French studies also become very relevant to the current discussion.

In a large study, \textcite{Treiman1983-jr} conducted seven different tests involving novel word games. The outcomes of these word games provided strong support for the existence of the onset and rime as internal components of the syllable. 
%Experiment 1 tested for rule preference referring to the onset in its entirety or one that refers to the first phoneme of the onset. The nonsense syllable word game had participants manipulate syllables according to the game rule training they received. In the training phase, participants were given four examples in order to learn the rules of the game. One example given by the experimenter was /kIg/ to which participants were to add the syllable /\ae z/ in order to arrive at the solution /k\ae z-Ig/. Participants were trained until they successfully solved 3 of the 4 training scenarios correctly. During the testing phase, participants were tested on a syllable with an onset consonant cluster such as /skef/ to which they were to add the syllable /\ae z/. If participants preferred to keep the onset intact, they would respond /sk\ae z-ef/. However, if breaking the onset cluster up was considered acceptable, they would answer /s\ae z-kef/ by adding the required syllable after the first phoneme. 
Participants had to manipulate nonsense syllables according to the rules of the game and preference to keep the onset intact supported the existence of the onset as an sub-syllabic unit. Even though this experiment was done auditorily, it was possible that orthography was driving the participant's response rather than phonology. \textcite{Treiman1983-jr} used a letter control condition to ensure participants were using sounds as opposed to their imagined spelling by taking advantage of single phonemes that mapped onto two graphemes. Trieman utilized /\texttheta/ and /\v{s}/ which are represented orthographically with two graphemes as 'th' and 'sh' respectively. %In these control cases, a preference for the letter rule would have resulted in /\v{s}og/ plus /\ae z/ becoming /s\ae z-hog/ 'saz-hog instead of /\v{s}\ae z-og/ 'shaz-og'. 
The results suggested that participants made their decisions based on phonology rather than orthography and as they continued to prefer keeping the onset intact. 
%rather than split the consonant cluster, even when the consonant cluster could have only been represented orthographically. 
This finding is important because even when orthographic representations of the item are available to them mentally, participants still relied on phonological structures to manipulate the syllables during the game. Further support for the onset being a cohesive unit came from \textcite{Treiman1986-nh}, which utilized a syllable blending task. Syllable blending requires a participant to take two separate syllables and combine parts of each syllable to create a new syllable. This task is very similar to the synonymic intrusions studied at the word level by \textcite{MacKay1972-ii}. \textcite{Treiman1986-nh} gave participants two monosyllabic nonsense syllables and combine them to create a new monosyllabic nonsense syllable. The results indicated that the preferred method of participants was to take the onset of the first syllable and combine it with the rime of the second syllable. This provided additional support of the onset which had been found previously in \textcite{Treiman1983-jr}. \textcite{Treiman1986-nh} increased the complexity of the syllable blending task by including three phoneme consonant clusters in the onset position. The results revealed that three consonant onsets were treated in the same manner as two consonant onsets. In other words, participants preferred to keep the onset intact and divide between the onset and rime regardless of the complexity of the onset.

In addition to the tasks that focused solely on onsets as a psychological reality, \textcite{Treiman1983-jr} used a syllable blending to test for the preference of splitting syllables into smaller proposed constituent parts such as the coda and rime. In this syllable game, participants had to learn four different rules that used monosyllabic CCVCC syllables---where C represents a consonant and V represents a vowel. %As before, the syllable blending involved combining two syllables to make a new monosyllabic syllable. The syllables /flirz/ and /gruns/ are used to illustrate each of the four games, which were administered to the same participants on four separate visits. In the first game, C-CVCC, the correct response would have been /fruns/, which split the onset of both syllables keeping only the first phoneme of syllable one and the final four phonemes of syllable two. The second game, CC-VCC, resulted in /fluns/, which combined the complete onset of the first syllable and the complete rime of the second syllable. The first two games allowed for a comparison of rules where one forced participants to split the onset consonant cluster and the other forced them to keep it intact. The third games, CCV-CC, resulted in /flins/ by taking the onset and vowel of the first syllable and the coda of second syllable. The final game, CCVC-C, resulted in /flirs/ by splitting the coda in both syllables to combine the first four phonemes of syllable one and the last phoneme of syllable two. Game three allowed researchers to compare preferences to keep the coda together as a cohesive unit with game four, which forced participants to split the coda consonant cluster. 
Participants chose to split and blend the syllables between the onset and rime and did so with less errors, % than the other three games. 
which garnered further support for the onset as cohesive unit. Interestingly though, the same support was not found for the coda as a cohesive unit. \textcite{Treiman1983-jr} found no preference for splitting between the vowel and coda, V.CC, or splitting the coda consonant cluster, VC.C. In short, the findings suggest that the logical sub-syllabic units making up syllables were the onset and the rime as they did not find consistent support for vowel and the coda division within the structure of the rime. %\textcite{Treiman1983-jr} then tested the same concept in the coda position. They trained participants with four examples again following this rule when adding the syllable /vi/ to the syllable /fug/ becomes /vig-fu/. The testing phase then included stimuli such as /w\textopeno st/ which could be repeated as /vist-w\textopeno/ in support of coda reality or as /vit-w\textopeno s/ in support of splitting the consonant cluster. Again, participants showed they responded based on phonology and preferred to keep the coda consonant cluster intact. 
Up to this point, everything studied with syllable blending had been done with nonsense syllables. \textcite{Treiman1986-nh} replicated the novel nonword games in \textcite{Treiman1983-jr} using real word stimuli in a syllable blending task. All of these results taken together suggested that the onset and the rime are the two psychologically relevant subunits of the syllable. 

After providing evidence for onset and rime as the internal structure of syllables for adults, \textcite{Treiman1985-zc} then analyzed the structure of the onset and rime as units in the spoken language of children. This task was addressed by having children substitute two phonemes in a syllable to create a new one. They learned two different games during separate sessions where the first game required the substitution of the first two phonemes with /l\textturnv/ and the second game required the substitution of the last two phonemes with /\textturnv l/ for CVC syllables. For the first CVC game, the substitution of the required the onset and nucleus to be replaced while the coda remained the same. For the second CVC game, replacing the last two phonemes resulted in leaving the onset unchanged and the entire rime being replaced. For the CCV syllable game, children learned that the first game required the first two phonemes to be substituted with /sl/ while the second game required the last two phonemes to be replaced with /li/. %\ttodo[inline]{see table 1 on page 165}
The first CCV game aligned the phoneme substitution with the complete onset and the rime being unchanged even though the coda position was empty. The second game for CCV syllables forced participants to substitute phonemes that split the onset consonant cluster. The results of the four games gave additional support for the cohesiveness of the onset and rime as logical subsyllabic units. Additional support for this claim also came from \textcite{Treiman1988-kt} who showed the nucleus of an English syllable is more closely associated to the phoneme that comes it after it---coda consonants---than the phonemes before it---onset consonants. Participants rated syllables as less acceptable when the syllable was not divided between the onset and coda and preferred blending syllables where the nucleus and coda remained intact. 

%\textcite{Treiman1985-zc} The third experiment confirmed that children again had more difficulty with onset consonant clusters than single consonant onsets showing that the onset of a syllable is a cohesive unit.

%In a reading-based study, \textcite{Treiman1985-zc} looked at the ability of children to read CVC and CCV nonwords. In this experiment the children produced the nonsense syllables and the responses were transcribed. The nonwords were paired where both nonwords contained the same phonemes but in a different order to create the two differing syllable structures. For example 'keer' was a CVC syllable that was paired with its CCV counterpart 'kree'. The results revealed that second grader out preformed first graders with their additional year of reading development. First graders successfully decoded CVC syllable much better than CCV syllables. This difference in syllable structure decoding had disappeared and both syllable types were decoded equally well by the second grade. Interestingly, the most common error of CCV syllable decoding was to transform the syllable into two different ones and effectively splitting the onset cluster. For example, the nonwords 'smoo' and 'sna' were erroneously produced by children as bisyllabic nonwords, 'so.mo' and 'sa.na' respectively. This error type suggests a preference for singleton onsets over complex onsets containing consonant clusters. This supported their findings in experiment 2 of the same study that showed children had more difficulty recognizing an individual phoneme when it was part of an onset consonant cluster. In the a seventh study, \textcite{Treiman1986-nh} replicated the phoneme substitution task that had been developed for children with adult. %When presented with CVC syllables, it was easier to substitute the last two phonemes. However, when presented with CCV syllables, it was easier to substitute the first two phonemes. These easier substitutions corresponded to substituting the onset or rime. 


With ample evidence in support of onsets and rimes, other variables began to be investigated. \textcite{Treiman1990-fw} studied college age students to see how they syllabify words, especially when considering medial consonant clusters. They used a forced-choice task where participants were given two or three options for the syllabification of the word. They also had to repeat one part of the word twice to test for ambisyllabicity. For example, \emph{quarter} may be repeated as quartquarter for the first syllable and quarterter for the second syllable. The fact that the /t/ could be considered part of the coda in the first syllable and part of the onset of the second syllable was an indicator of ambisyllabicity. This was thought to be related to spelling as well so participants were asked to spell the words at the end of the experiment. This is first study that utilized a forced-choice task to elicit syllable intuition. Since they were successful at learning about a participant's syllabic knowledge through this task, a modified version of this task would also be sufficient in eliciting syllable intuitions of participants in the current study through a visual experimental design. 

Syllabic intuitions and the fact that sub-syllabic structures affect how English speakers has been thoroughly covered, but the same is not true for Spanish. Therefore, French studies that were based in syllabic intuitions are reviewed. The results from the following studies should be comparable to Spanish, the language being tested in the current study, because they are both romance languages that do not allow for ambisyllabicity. \textcite{Content2001-uh,Goslin2000-ul} were two crucial studies focused on syllabic intuitions because they tested a participant's ability to play with segments to create syllable boundaries in nonwords.

In an attempt to gain a better understanding of syllable boundaries, \textcite{Goslin2000-ul} conducted a French syllable repetition task with bisyllabic nonwords where participants repeated the first or the second syllable, but never both. They found differences in the French speaker's syllabification patterns as a result of experimental conditions for nonword structures VCV, VCCV and VCCCV. The nonwords were presented auditorily to the participant. In condition one, the participant had to repeat first syllable and in condition 2, they had to repeat the second syllable. All participants responded to the same stimuli in both conditions allowing for a within-subjects comparison. The French subjects all converged on consistent segmentation patterns in the bisyllabic nonwords that contained between one and three medial consonants. For single consonants, V.CV was preferred. For double consonants a VC.CV segmentation pattern was preferred unless the two consonants were an obstruent + liquid---/gr, br/ or /gl/ causing V.CCV to be preferred. In the three consonant nonwords, VC.CCV was preferred unless the second consonant was an /s/ in which case VCC.CV was the preferred choice. These results in French are in line with the results for syllabic intuitions expected in Spanish. Spanish prefers single consonant onsets while allowing for complex two-consonant onsets containing an obstruent + a liquid. Furthermore, Spanish also only allows for complex codas when the second consonant is an /s/ just as was shown in the French results. Lastly, the results of the French syllabic intuitions showed no effects of ambisyllabicity, which is exactly what would be expected in the Spanish group of the current study. These comparisons support the fact that both French and Spanish should contrast English in similar ways given the phonological systems. This makes Spanish--English bilinguals an ideal testing group to better understand Spanish syllabic intuitions since they have access to the contrasting phonological systems. Therefore any differences in syllabic intuitions between the L1 Spanish and L1 English groups that may be found could be tied to language background or dominance.

Adding some complexity to the the syllable repetition task, \textcite{Content2001-uh} tested French speakers with an auditory syllable reversal task. This task required participants to repeat the syllables of bisyllabic words they heard in the reverse order. For example, if the participant heard \emph{palais}, the should repeat back to the experimenter \emph{lais.pa}. During the syllable reversal task, they found support for ambisyllabicity in French, which went against the traditional French syllabification constraints. In order to further investigate, they also used a repetition paradigm where participants were asked to repeat the first or second syllable of the word they heard. In a final experiment, participants were asked to use a sentence in order to complete the repetition of requested syllables in order to avoid participants merely repeating what they had heard. This was a simple method of complicating the syllable reversal task by requiring additional language production from the participant. Ultimately, the French results for intervocalic consonant syllabifications were comparable to previous English findings in the same environment, which allowed for ambisyllabicity. While this certainly would make French less comparable to Spanish in this regard, spelling was also a significant factor in the French results. French has a more opaque orthographic system than Spanish, which has very few exceptions to its one grapheme to one phoneme correlation. It does however open the possibility that similar results could be found in a Spanish syllabic intuition task. %While these tasks may be informative for the production studies, it was not considered crucial in the current study since the main goal sought to link syllable intuitions to visual word segmentation abilities.
%\ttodo{This is not true. Then you get to the French studies by Frauenfelder and colleagues. These are the most directly relevant studies discussed by you: they are on French, which has a syllable structure similar to Spanish, and they are on syllabic intuitions, which is what you're talking about in this chapter (forget about other chapters when writing this chapter). Yet, you say "while these tasks may be informative for the production studies, it was not considered crucial in the current study since the main goal sought to link syllable intuitions to visual word segmentation abilities. Absolutely not! These were the ONLY studies you needed to discuss in detail. Yes, you're right: they asked their participants to produce sounds outloud. Yet, these were not production studies per se, they are still intuition studies. It's true their task is different from yours, but their goals are pretty much the same as yours: assess intuition.} 
%The current study decided to narrow the potential answers to the two-alternative forced choice task that matched the CV and CVC syllable types manipulated in the visual word segmentation experiments.


%Not everyone agreed with the conclusions drawn about English onset--rime divisions \ttodo[inline]{Clements and Keyser 1983, Pierrehumbert and Nair 1995; What did they say? Explain the counter argument}. \textcite{Treiman1995-fi} was an article defense in response to critics that disagreed with the structure of the English syllable consisting of onset and rime. Pierrehumber and Nair 1995 argued that the theoretical foundations of the research were fine, but the interpretation of the output should be viewed differently in which they concluded that syllables have a moraic structure. \ttodo[inline]{Don't add much content here, but as it stands, it is unclear how this argues against what has been explained in the chapter thus far.} \textcite{Treiman1995-fi} relied on recent statistical research related to phonemic distribution in English to support the arguement that the rime is a central part in the phonemic structure.


%\subsection{Syllables for Reading Ability}
%\ttodo[inline]{I can't follow the explanation in the section 3.2.1. I'm not sure it's relevant. If it is, leave it. I'm just not sure it's much different from what you have been discussing, so I don't see the point of putting it in its own section. As long as papers are about assessing sylabic intuitions (and not utilizing syllabic knowledge to do something else, like segmenting words, finding words in the lexicon, or learning to read), the papers are relevant to your purposes.} 

%In order to study phonological processes through visual experiments rather than auditory experiments, it is important to understand that reading interfaces with the phonological system. The implications and roles of phonological activation can also be traced in discussions encompassing the prediction of later outcomes in reading \parencite{Treiman1985-zc} and spelling \parencite{Treiman1988-kt,Treiman1990-fw}. \textcite{Goswami1991-fu} questioned the connection between the structure of syllables and the ability of children learning to read and spell. They tested this connection through a training task with word games where the experimenter emphasized the consonant cluster. In the game, participants were given a clue word such as \emph{trim} and asked to read it for the experimenter during the testing phase. They had three separate conditions in which they tested during which the clue word remained visible to the participant. They were asked to read new experimental words using the information they had just learned from the clue word. The first was a phonological condition aligning with onset using words \emph{trot, trap} and \emph{tred}. In this condition the consonant cluster contained the same two phonemes and shared the same syllable structure. The second, a common unit condition that retained the same syllable structure, but both onset phonemes differed. Test words for the common unit condition included \emph{blot, snap} and \emph{sled}. The third condition changed the syllable structure, but shared the first phoneme as in words \emph{tint, tart} and \emph{torn}. A similar setup was done for codas exemplified here \emph{limp} for words \emph{camp, dump} and \emph{romp} in the phonological condition aligning with coda. Words \emph{caps, duct} and \emph{rods} were used in the common unit condition with shared coda structure, but contained differing phonemes. The third condition used words \emph{grip, slop} and \emph{clap} for the shared last phoneme condition that was constructed with a different syllable structure. See Table \ref{tab-goswami-examples}.

%\end{table}

%The results showed that phonological condition was significantly better than other conditions. However, this was only true for onsets as the coda did not produce the same effect \parencite{Goswami1991-fu}. In other words, children were able to use their knowledge to read a new word with the same onset conditions with a shared syllable structure better than when only internal structure remained intact or a single shared phoneme was present. This was taken to suggest that phonology does play a role in learning to read and spell instead of being solely an orthographic process. The role of phonology comes out because in this process because the effect is tied to only one subsyllabic unit---the onset. If learning had been a simple process of letter recognition, then the same effect should have been found in the coda position as well, but was not the case. This also adds to the evidence that of the onset as a cohesive unit but not the coda. Many previous studies showed that the rime was the second cohesive unit of the internal syllable structure without making strong claims about the internal structure of the rime, a nucleus and coda. \textcite{Goswami1991-fu} conducted a second experiment aimed at investigating the rime as a cohesive unit by adding a vowel to clue words. This resulted in a condition where the complete rime was shared between the clue word and phonological condition aligning with the rime, which produced significant results between pre and post tests compared to the other two conditions. Again this supported the existence of the rime as a cohesive unit. It provided evidence that children could productively utilize the rime in the process of learning to read and spell.

%Additional support for the role of phonology in learning to read and spell comes from studies comparing children to adults and illiterate to literate participants. \textcite{Treiman2002-im} compared differences between three groups of children---first, second and sixth grades, and one group of adult undergraduate students. They were asked to repeat the first and last parts of the experimental stimuli. The experimental stimuli looked at the difference between single and double medial consonants: \emph{carol, habit, money} versus \emph{parrot, rabbit, tunnel}. The participants completed the first part condition separately from the last part condition to avoid potential effects that repetition of both parts repeated together may have on syllabification. Following the syllabification, participants were asked to choose the correct spelling from two options. The interesting findings of this study show that the while children beginning to read can complete this task, orthographic representations have little effect on their phonological representations. By the sixth grade, however, orthographic representation have begun to modify their syllabification patterns with significantly more words containing double medial consonants being placed in the coda of the first syllable and the onset of the second syllable. These findings support the connections between phonology and reading as the ability to read activates the phonological representations of the word. It is a strong enough to effect the phonological representations of the participant. \textcite{Goslin2007-xf} also completed a syllable repetition task with pre-literate children and adults. In this case the participants were asked to insert a pause where the syllable boundary would be. They hoped to determine whether or not becoming literate in French would affect the phonological syllabification rules. They found that adults and children did not differ  in syllabification as a result orthographic influence that is obtained during the process of becoming literate. This lack of difference supports that phonology is involved. 

%\ttodo[inline]{The following paragraph is engaging in a secondary point. This point is not motivating the study at all. If it is connected then it should be placed in its own section and include more than two references. It is likely that this aspect is not necessary to motivate as phonology in segmentation chapters was.}

%The conflicting results of \textcite{Treiman2002-im} where orthography did affect phonology in English and the unaffected French phonology in \textcite{Goslin2007-xf} suggest that syllabification is not completely an orthographic or phonological process. Rather, it is some combination of the two processes at work in determining a person's syllabification patterns. One possibility that caused the orthography in French to not affect the phonological syllabification is the transparency of the orthographic system. In French, there are many orthographic representations that map to the same phonological representation and therefore may not be a reliable process for French speakers. In English, orthographic--phonological correspondence is still not transparent, but more so than French. This difference could explain the results of the two studies. Spanish has even more transparency in its orthography--phonology mappings. Therefore, it could be proposed that the orthography will affect the phonology. However, another explanation may exist as well and that is in the clarity of syllable boundaries. Both French and Spanish have clear syllable boundaries without ambisyllabicity. English on other hand does contain ambisyllabic phonemes which are syllabified as the coda of the first syllable and the onset of the following syllable. Since the current study is focused on Spanish and English, differences between Spanish and English syllables are discussed in the next section.


%\ttodo[inline]{ I don't understand the point of discussing Cutler and Norris, and Cutler and Carter in pages 112 and 113. What do they have to do with "Spanish and English syllable structure"? Not sure Keffala et al is relevant either. Your study is not about implicit syllabic knowledge, but about explicit syllabic intuitions.}

%\textcite{Cutler1987-pn} investigated speech production and the boundaries that differentiate or signal word segmentation and potentially also serve a key for lexical access. The intensity of the syllable in English was proposed by \textcite{Cutler1988-kg} where they noted that there are two different syllable types in terms of stress---a strong syllable contains a full vowel while a weak syllable contains a reduced vowel. Through the analysis of two online dictionaries, \textcite{Cutler1987-pn} noted that words in English began with a strong syllable nearly three times more than words that began with a weak syllable. \textcite{Cutler1987-pn} tested the stress-based proposal of \textcite{Cutler1988-kg} against a corpus of British English comprised of nearly 190000 words. They analyzed this corpus according to closed versus open word classes. Closed word classes contained grammatical function words such as articles, conjunctions and pronouns---\emph{i.e. the, a, their, and, but, she, it}---whereas open word classes contained content words which fall into grammatical categories of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Through this analysis, \textcite{Cutler1987-pn} found that open class words began with a strong word initial syllable with much more frequency than with a weak word initial syllable. The reverse was found for closed class function words revealing that the majority of these words began with a weak word initial syllable. They argued that these probabilities may lead English speakers to utilize the word stress realized as strong syllables to segment the speech stream to find meaning in the utterances they hear. If this were true, then all Spanish words would be perceived as a content, or open class, words for English speakers applying their native-based segmentation strategy to their L2 Spanish. The nature of speech perception and production also depends upon the nature of the monolingual and bilingual speakers. Much of the previous research has suggested that  English speakers, monolingual and bilinguals, utilize a stress-based segmentation and are unable to use a syllable-based segmentation strategy always found in French monolinguals. The syllable-based processing strategy has been found under certain conditions for Italian, Catalan and Spanish speakers as well. \ttodo{This study was all about stress. Probably needs to be deleted, but is ambisyllabicity attached to stress and predictable in English as a result?}

%Through the testing of English, it was overwhlemingly evident that a unique pattern of syllables structure existed in terms of an onset and a rime. Similarly, linguists have shown restrictions on where the phoneme occur and how they combine, which are dependent the internal syllable position. \ttodo[inline]{who did this need references; This also seems out of place and may be a good conclusion statement.} 

%\parencite{Kessler1997-oj} analyzed 2001 English CVC words to see if probabilistic patterns also existed. The results revealed a relationship between the consonant and the preceding vowel, but not for the the consonant preceding the vowel. Several rime combinations ocurred much more often than expected. Therefore, additional support for English CVC syllables being made up of an onset and rime was given. \ttodo[inline]{This study should be reveiwed to understand it better}

%\ttodo[inline]{The next paragraph should be in a different section as it is not about English and Spanish syllable structure. It does add value because of it tie to bilingualism.}

Lastly, research into syllable factors have also been undertaken with bilingual groups as well. \textcite{Keffala2018-ta} investigated Spanish--English bilingual children for effects of language specific syllable type, frequency and complexity may have in the acquisition of syllable structure for English and Spanish. Utilizing monolingual controls for both English and Spanish, they compared the productions of onset consonant clusters and single phoneme codas by bilingual children with a picture naming task. Several interesting results were found. For the codas, the bilinguals outperformed their Spanish monolinguals counterparts while showing no delay when compared to English monolinguals. In addition, the bilinguals outperformed both control groups in their onset acquisition of consonant clusters. The current chapter hopes to continue adding to the knowledge base of syllabic intuition of Spanish--English bilinguals. Chapters \ref{ch-seg-lab} and \ref{ch-seg-online} connects explicit syllabic intuition with implicit syllabic intuitions that are tested through word segmentation abilities.


\section{Present Study}
%\ttodo[inline]{The "The present study" section needs to be extended to include the following: a clear, motivated research question; a set of predictions or hypotheses; to explain all this, you're going to need to say something about the structure and design of the experimental task, do so. By page 114 I still do not know why you're even comparing Spanish and English participants. Why would anybody care? It's your jobn to make them care.}
The current experiment set out to gain an understanding of how well participants can accurately syllabify syllables of Spanish. The syllable intuition experiment is an important step in the process because how a person syllabifies words should have a direct effect on other languages processes that rely on the syllable in some way. Potential examples include how fast a participant can retrieve a lexical item from their mental lexicon or how useful the syllable is in their language segmentation abilities. The current dissertation is focused on the latter of the two processes---word segmentation. It is expected that syllabic intuitions will vary based on being a L1 speaker of Spanish or a L1 speaker of English even though all participants were bilingual Spanish--English speakers. These expected differences in syllabification patterns are likely to stem from L1 background or language dominance, which match in the current project due to predetermined recruitment and inclusion criteria. This experiment begins to build a database of Spanish–English bilinguals syllabification patterns of Spanish words, which could help to determine whether or not language dominance is the source of different syllabification patterns. The main question is interested in whether or not L1 Spanish speakers have differing syllabic intuitions for Spanish syllables than L1 English speakers.

%The main question this chapter seeks to answer is whether or not speakers segment words differently. If they do, how do they differ between groups of speakers and/or syllable structure type---CV or CVC.

In order to collect intuitions on syllables of Spanish, participants were given a two-alternative forced choice task that was a modified version of the data collection task used by \textcite{Treiman1990-fw}. In the current study, the two-alternative forced choice task was only concerned with the word-initial syllable structure rather than the complete syllabification of the word. During the syllable intuition experiment, participants were visually shown a word on the screen, which was replaced by letter sequences of two or three letters. The letter sequences represented the CV or CVC initial syllable options for the word that had just been presented. %\todo{removed because not all participants in this chapter were tested on segmentation strategies. some were tested on lexical access which is not reported on in this dissertation}This is the first study to my knowledge that has elicited syllabification patterns of experimental items used in a visual letter sequence monitoring task in order to connect syllabification of items to segmentation results with the same participants. This is not an important point either because it does not matter whether the words were identical, only that the type of words were similar.
As with all experimental designs, running the experiment came with some assumptions in order to interpret the results. It accepts the fact that only CV and CVC syllable types were used in experimental items although this is only a subset of valid syllable structures in Spanish. An important distinction to make is the difference between implicit and explicit knowledge. Chapters \ref{ch-seg-lab} and \ref{ch-seg-online} conduct visual word segmentation experiments where implicit phonological awareness is tested because participants were never told that they were monitoring for syllables. However, the current chapter on syllabic intuitions is testing explicit phonological awareness because participants are being asked to choose the first syllable of the word. In other words, participants in this chapter knew that they were identifying syllables and not some other linguistic unit.
 

%\ttodo{make sure these two concepts are not confused: Intuition in this chapter is explicit knowledge or phonological awareness because participants are being asked to choose the first syllable of the word. This is different from chapters 4 and 5 where segmentation is testing implicit phonological awareness because participants are never told that they are monitoring for a syllable.}
%\ttodo{Remove this paragraph because it does not need to be explicitly stated in this chapter. It applies vacously that if they are explicitly choosing syllables then phonology is involved.} This design assumed that participants were actually activating the phonological representation of the syllables and words they read on the screen. There was likely a role or effect of orthography at play as well, but the current design of the project did not allow for teasing these two apart. For a full discussion on this topic, refer to Chapter \ref{ch-intro} Section \ref{sec-phon-activation}. 

%\ttodo[inline]{Use laymen terms, i.e. Red button/Green button which is somewhere below. The research questions are around native syllable intuitions, language dominance and ambisyllabicity. Currently the motivation is missing. balada will be affected by ambisyllabicity while balcón will not. Explain this, talk about predictions. Lastly add explicit fully operationalized research questions here: How will Spanish speaker syllabify words like balada versus other words like balcón. This explicit research question would be paired to the broader RQ at the opening of the chapter: Does syllable affect segmentation}

Due to the fact that the L1 backgrounds differ between groups of participants in the current study, several predictions can be made. Since the experiment is conducted in Spanish, it is expected that the L1 Spanish group will have a high degree of consistency in their syllabic intuitions causing them to perform at or near the accuracy ceiling. The L1 English group is expected to perform less consistently or accurately when compared to the L1 Spanish group. The main reason for this prediction is that L1 English speakers could transfer their phonological knowledge of ambisyllabicity to the L2 Spanish. A difference in syllabic intuitions would result in lower accuracy rates because of words such as \emph{paloma}. L1 Spanish speakers will only have one syllabification pattern---\emph{pa.lo.ma} or word-initial CV structure. L1 English speakers will have two potential syllabification patterns---\emph{pa.lo.ma} and \emph{pal.lo.ma}. L1 English speakers choosing the second option would be indicating that the word-initial syllable structure was CVC rather than the CV L1 Spanish speakers should be in agreement with. Words that create environments where ambisyllabicity can occur will be responsible for lower accuracy rates because other words such as \emph{palmera} will be syllabified in the same manner by both groups. L1 English speakers will not syllabify as \emph{pal.lme.ra} because /lm/ is an illegal onset in English just as it is in Spanish. Therefore, both groups should consistently syllabify as \emph{pal.me.ra}, which indicates a CVC word-initial syllable structure choice. Similar predictions would be made for the intervocalic /r/ in Spanish word pairing \emph{joroba--jornada}. These intervocalic liquids, /r/ and /l/, are prime candidates for ambisyllabicity to appear in English. This should cause differences in syllabification patterns of the Spanish stimuli, but only within the L1 English group.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Participants}
\label{sub-intuition-part}
All participants reported in this chapter were recruited for experiments that took place in an in-person laboratory setting. Two groups of participants took part in the syllabic intuition experiment. L1 Spanish speakers who were second language learners of English served as the control group. L1 English speakers who were second language learners of Spanish were used for the target group. All recruited participants resided in their L1 environment, or birth country, at the time of data collection. 

Due to the methods used in data collection several pre-analysis steps were conducted to ensure that participants actually represented the intended group for which they were recruited. The participants were placed into their appropriate group based off of the additional data collected through the LexTALE, LexTALE-Esp and the Bilingual Language Profile (BLP) tasks that were completed during the same visit as syllabic intuition task. The BLP, the LexTALE and the LexTALE-Esp vocabulary tests are described in full detail in Chapter \ref{ch-sampling} Section \ref{sec-instruments}. Since these tasks were completed during a single experimental session, it was not always possible to determine whether or not all participants were representative of the group until after all information had been collected and additional linguistic measures and language background had been thoroughly reviewed. Figure \ref{plt-intuition-eng-vocab} shows the distribution of vocabulary scores for English in terms of percent correct responses to the LexTALE task while Figure \ref{plt-intuition-izura-vocab} shows the vocabulary scores for Spanish calculated by the method given in \textcite{Izura2014-yw}---referred to as the Izura score throughout the remainder of this dissertation. The percentage score was also calculated for the percent correct responses to LexTALE-Esp items in order to calculate the difference between L1 and L2 vocabulary sizes. Participants analyzed in this chapter were those who had a larger L1 vocabulary relative to their L2 vocabulary size. These participants were removed because having a larger L2 vocabulary is an indicator of a stronger language dominance in their second language than their L1. Figure \ref{plt-intuition-vocab-diff} shows the difference between English and Spanish vocabulary sizes and Figure \ref{plt-intuition-lang-dom} shows the language dominance score calculated from the BLP. Both of these figures show two clearly distinct groups of participants that align with this chapters control and target groups.

In total, there were \Sexpr{intuition_stat_compare["English", "n"] + intuition_stat_compare["Spanish", "n"] + nrow(intuition_remove_part)} participants that completed the study. Using responses to the BLP, \Sexpr{intuition_part_removal_sum["fluency-English", "n"] + intuition_part_removal_sum["location-Spanish", "n"] + intuition_part_removal_sum["dominance-English", "n"] + intuition_part_removal_sum["dominance-Spanish", "n"]} were removed because they did not accurately represent the groups for which they had been recruited. \Sexpr{intuition_part_removal_sum["fluency-English", "n"]} L1 English speaker was removed because they reported fluency in languages other than Spanish and English. \Sexpr{intuition_part_removal_sum["location-Spanish", "n"]} L1 Spanish speakers were removed because they reported being born and/or raised outside of Mexico. \Sexpr{intuition_part_removal_sum["dominance-English", "n"] + intuition_part_removal_sum["dominance-Spanish", "n"]} participants were removed because they were outliers in terms of language dominance scores calculated by the BLP. Lastly, using the scores from both the LexTALE and LexTALE-Esp, \Sexpr{intuition_part_removal_sum["vocabulary-Spanish", "n"]} L1 Spanish speakers were removed because their scores indicated a larger L2 English vocabulary size than their L1 Spanish vocabulary size.

\subsection{Materials \& Design}
The syllabic intuitions were elicited from participants through a two-alternative forced choice task and were given as much time as needed to respond. Participants were shown a real word in Spanish on the screen and then were presented with two options below that represented a CV or CVC structure. The two options reflected the spelling of the word, where the CV option shows the first two letters and the CVC option shows the first three letters. There were 24 critical word pairs and were the same real word stimuli used in a visual segmentation experiment, which is discussed in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab}. Each word pair shared the first three letters, but differed in initial syllable structure. Using the example word pair \emph{peseta--pestaña} 'cent--tab'  to illustrate, it can easily been seen that both words begin with the letters \emph{pes}. However, the initial syllable structure of \emph{peseta} is \emph{pe}, a CV structure, while the initial syllable structure of \emph{pestaña} is \emph{pes}, a CVC structure, when following standard Spanish syllabification. All other word pairs followed the same pattern in that the first three letters were shared, but one word had a CV word-initial syllable structure and the other word began with a CVC syllable. 

The order of presentation for the two syllabic options, CV or CVC, remained the same for the entire experiment for the participant, but was counterbalanced across participants. In order to counterbalance for visual presentation in this task, half of the participants used the green response button on the left side of the response box to indicate a CVC response and the red response button on the right side of the response box to indicate a CV response while the other half of the participants did the opposite. Since the position of response buttons aligned with screen position, half of the participants visually saw the orthographic representation of the CVC syllable to the left of screen center and the CV syllable option on the right while the other half of the participants saw the opposite visual displays for orthographic representations of syllable choices.


\subsection{Procedure}
Participants were seated in front of a laptop computer connected to a USB button box in order to complete the experiment in PsychoPy \parencite{Peirce2019-dm}. At the beginning of the experiment, participants entered in demographic information as asked in the Basic Language Profile (BLP). Once they had entered the demographic information, the participants were instructed that they would see Spanish words presented individually on the computer screen and that each word would be followed by two options for the first syllable of the presented word. There was no time constraint for the participant to select the option that they considered to be the first syllable of the presented word and the experiment would not progress until the participant had indicated a response. %\ttodo[inline]{In the second experiment (Lexical Access), this was initially ran with 4 second time limit. It affected participants 062, 065-067, 069-072, 074-076 so these 11 participants should be checked for missing values. This should probably be a footnote to show missing values. No missing values occurred as a result.} 
In total, there were 10 practice trials that followed the same criteria and procedure as the 48 experimental trials presented to the participants. For each trial, the word in lowercase letters appeared in the center of the screen for 1500 milliseconds before being replaced by the two syllable options---one a CV syllable and the other a CVC syllable---which remained on the screen in all capital letters until a response was entered. Following each response, the screen remained blank for 500 milliseconds before the next word appeared. %\ttodo[inline]{It may be good to create a visual representation of the experiment here to illustrate what each participant saw.} 

%For half of the participants, the CV syllable option was on the left side of the screen while the CVC syllable option was on the right. For the other half of the participants, the CVC syllable option was on the left side of the screen while the CV syllable option was on the right. Participants were given separate instruction screens for practice and experimental trials that differed only in letting the participant know whether they are about to enter a practice or experimental phase.

All participants recruited for this study completed the current experiment as an additional task of two additional ongoing experiments. \Sexpr{intuition_exp_origin["Segmentation","n"]} participants completed this syllable intuition experiment following a visual word segmentation experiment reported on in Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} while \Sexpr{intuition_exp_origin["Lexical_Access","n"]} completed it following a lexical access experiment that is not reported on in this dissertation. Depending on the prior experiment completed during the same lab session, the overall procedural order of tasks in the lab changed\footnote{When the syllable intuition experiment followed the visual segmentation experiment, participants began the experimental session with the Spanish vocabulary task---LexTALE-Esp. Immediately upon the completion of the LexTALE-Esp, participants were given instructions for the practice portion of the visual segmentation experiment. Following the practice portion, participants were given an instruction screen that indicated they had completed the practice portion, reminded about the controls needed for the experiment, allowed to ask any remaining question about the process. When the participant was ready to begin the actual experiment, they pressed the white button on the response box to begin. Once the participants had finished the entire visual segmentation experiment, they were presented with instructions for the practice trials of the syllable intuition experiment. Once they completed the practice trials, they were given a second instruction screen indicating they had completed the practice portion and were about to begin the real experiment. Once participants had completed the syllabic intuition experiment, they completed the LexTALE-Eng followed by the BLP. 

When the syllable intuition experiment followed the lexical decision based visual masked priming experiment, the order differed slightly. In this scenario, participants were immediately presented with instructions for practice trials for the lexical decision priming experiment. Once they had completed the practice trials, a new instruction screen appeared stating that they were getting ready to start the actual experimental trials. Then participants received instructions for the syllable intuition practice trials, which upon completion was immediately followed by a second instruction screen indicating that they were about to begin the experiment where responses would be stored. Then, the three additional linguistic skill and background tasks---LexTALE-Esp, LexTALE-Eng and the BLP---were completed in this order before the experimental session concluded.}.

%\ttodo[inline]{logit transformation: it expands the short tail and compresses the long tail. This results in expanison at the ends and compression in the center creating a more linear fit. Since I have read some on this topic, it would be wise to include the formula and a reference to its use in the analysis section.}


\subsection{Analysis}
%\ttodo[inline]{This interpretation is framed in terms of Correct/Incorrect. Linguists have framed these syllabification patterns to be correct: ba.la.da CV and bal.cón CVC or incorrect: ba.la.da CVC and bal.cón CV. Explicitly state that ba.la.da as CV and bal.cón as CVC are defined as correct (1) and any other answer as incorrect (0) in the current study to give readers a definition as to how to interpret these results. In the definition of these terms it may help to put them in double quotes: "correct", "incorrect" and "accuracy".}

In this analysis, there are a few terms that need to be defined in order to interpret the results below. The term "correct" has been attributed to CV responses for words like \emph{ba.la.da} and \emph{ca.mi.sa} while a CVC response to these items were counted as "incorrect". Similarly, CVC responses were scored as correct for \emph{bal.do.sa} and \emph{cam.pa.na} while a CV response was considered incorrect. Correct scores were given a value of 1 and incorrect responses were given a value of 0. The term "accuracy" in this chapter refers to the proportion of correct responses. In the first step of the analysis, the accuracy score was calculated for each participant as the proportion of correct responses. Each participant received two individual scores, one average for CV syllables and a second for the average of CVC syllables. The accuracy data then underwent a logit transformation. The untransformed accuracy scores have been used in the descriptive statistics while the logit transformed scores were utilized for inferential statistics. The dataset contained raw proportion correct and logit transformed correct response rates for both L1 Spanish speakers and L1 English speakers. The data structure contained a between-subjects factor of \emph{Group} with two levels---L1 Spanish and L1 English speakers. The dataset also contained a second factor, \emph{Structure}, that was within-subjects and also included two levels---CV and CVC syllable structure. The complete dataset consisted of 
\Sexpr{nrow(intuition_syl_ag)} 
observations---

\section{Results}
%\ttodo[inline]{Could you rethink, reframe the way you talk about your dependent variable (and thus your research question?). It's not about whether one group is better than the other, or whether one group is more likely to be correct or more likely to be accurate. You need to be a bit more careful explaining this. Your question is whether native Spanish and nonnative Spanish speakers have diferent syllabic intuitions (explicitly) when asked to syllabify Spanish words. Are they different? (Not, is one better?). Now, this forces you to ask yourself the question: Why would I expect them to be different? And here is why you need to explain all this earlier in the chapter: You would exxpect them to be different because Spanish and English differ in their syllable structure; among other things, English has ambisyllabicity and Spanish does not, does this mean that Spanish and English speakers will have different syllabic intuitions? Does this mean that second language learners of Spanish whose L1 is English will base some of their intuitions on their knowledge of English? More narrowly: do L1 English L2 Spanish learners apply ambisylabicity to some Spanish words? When describing your dependent variable, try to say things like: "based on the standard phonological description of Spanish, a CVCV sequence will be syllabified as CV.CV and not as CVC.V, neither will the intervocalic vowel be ambisyllabic." Your assumption to classify responses as "correct" or "incorrect" is based on the standard description for Spanish; don't make it sound as a matter of fact (correct, incorrect).}

The main question that this study sought to answer was whether or not L1 Spanish speakers and L1 English speakers differed in the accuracy in which they could syllabify words of Spanish. The syllabification patterns of the two groups were elicited through a two-alternative forced choice task where they had to indicate the structure of the word-initial syllable. Table \ref{tab-intuition-grp-score} reports the means and standard deviations of the accuracy scores in terms of proportion of correct responses and their corresponding logit transformed values. These averages were computed for the CV and CVC syllables separately and for each group independently.

\end{table}

As can be seen in Table \ref{tab-intuition-grp-score}, neither group performed at the ceiling rate of 100 percent accuracy for either syllable type. The L1 Spanish control group had an average accuracy rate of 95 percent for CV syllables and 97 percent for CVC syllable structures. The L1 English target group scored 73 and 90 percent for the same corresponding syllable structures. When looking at the raw percentages, it shows that the correct response rate to CV syllables by L1 Spanish controls, their worst condition, was better than the correct response rate to CVC syllables by L1 English speakers, which was their best condition. In other words, the worst case scenario for the Spanish group out preformed the best case scenario for the English group. Figure \ref{plt-intuition-corr-prop} illustrates these findings as well as the trend of both groups to respond more accurately to CVC syllables than CV syllables.

%Since there were participants in both groups that did perform at or near ceiling, a logit tranformation was performed on the proportion data to get a more linear fit for comparision purposes by cutting out the extreme end points \ttodo[inline]{This is still unclear and I don't think its current form is an accurate statement}. 
In order to check the significance of these relationships, the logit transformed data was submitted to an analysis of variance.

While neither group individually responded more accurately to one syllable type over the other, the trend was in the direction of favoring CVC syllables for both groups. The L1 Spanish group was more accurate for both syllable types when compared to the L1 English group. Figure \ref{plt-intuition-logit-prop} again shows the comparison of correct responses between the L1 Spanish and L1 English groups split by syllable structure type. The deviation by group from the standard Spanish syllabification pattern captured as error rates clearly shows that the L1 Spanish control group responded more accurately to both syllable types than the L1 English target group. %\ttodo[inline]{Page 129.

\section{Discussion}
%\ttodo[inline]{Discussion. We need a proper discussion, at least three times longer. The Discussion needs to summarize the findings in plain English, then discuss them one by one in the context of the literature you discussed in the Background section, then discuss them in the context of your research question and your predictions. Were your predictions correct? Why not. You may explain what are some possible limitations of the study, but this is rather secondary. The current version of the Discussion focuses exclusively on secondary issues.}

This chapter reported on the \Sexpr{nrow(intuition_desc)} bilingual Spanish--English participants who completed a Spanish syllabification experiment. Crucially, the experiment ran in this chapter investigated whether or not the two groups agreed on the syllabic structures of Spanish they were segmenting as a result of L1 background. The results indicated that the two groups differed in their abilities to correctly syllabify Spanish syllables when compared to the standard Spanish syllabification patterns set forth by theoretical phonology. The L1 Spanish speakers performed much closer to the prescribed syllabification patterns than the L1 English speakers. While this result may seem obvious on the surface, the effects it may have on other language processing skills is likely to be substantial. Since this difference was found when asking the participants to identify the first syllable of the word, it is possible that differences could also be found in lexical access. Previous lexical access research that has been done suggested the word initial syllable may be a key to accessing the mental lexicon \parencite{Cooper2002-rx,Cutler1988-kg,Tabossi2000-xn,Tagliapietra2009-uc}. It may also affect word segmentation abilities in that the breaking down of words into syllables could be different. For a full discussion on Spanish word segmentation, see Chapters \ref{ch-seg-lab} and \ref{ch-seg-online} of this dissertation. Chapter \ref{ch-seg-lab} reports on the same participants discussed in the current chapter who completed the in-person visual segmentation experiment less the participants who completed the lexical access experiment, which was not reported in this project due to insufficient data collection at the time that COVID-19 broke out.

The discussion now returns the main research question on whether or not Spanish syllabic intuitions differ between L1 Spanish speakers and L1 English speakers. Indeed, the results showed that these groups differed from one another. As predicted, the L1 Spanish group had a higher accuracy rate, or within group consensus, than the L1 English group for both syllable types. These results point to differences in L1 background or language dominance. In the current study, all participants had a language dominance that aligned with their L1 background. Therefore, it was not possible to determine whether L1 background or language dominance was responsible for the differences in syllabic intuitions between the two groups. In order to differentiate these two factors, a study would need to be designed that investigated speaker groups that had a language dominance that aligned with their L2 rather than their L1. For example, L1 Spanish speakers who had immigrated to an English speaking region and had become more dominant in the L2 English would be an ideal candidate. Likewise, an L1 English speaker who had immigrated to Spanish speaking region and become more dominant in their L2 Spanish would also be ideal candidate. While this study recruited people for in-person experiments, a syllabic intuition study using a visual presentation method could easily be conducted online. With many online participant pools such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific, online studies have become much easier to conduct and allow researchers access to more specific and targeted populations that would otherwise be unreachable.

The results clearly establish a difference in syllabic intuitions between L1 Spanish and L1 English speaking groups. Overall, there were less accurate responses to CV syllables than CVC syllables when looking at the pooled data from both groups. This finding was in line with the hypothesis that the CV stimuli in this study would be susceptible to ambisyllabicity. A reduction in the consensus of the syllabification of CV syllables should have been found if the L1 English group transferred there knowledge of ambisyllabicity to their L2 Spanish. Since Spanish does not permit ambisyllabicity, L1 English speakers will diverge from the standard Spanish syllabification patterns in word such as \emph{balada}, but not in words such as \emph{baldosa}. Thus, where the intervocalic liquid has the option to pulled into the coda position of the word-initial syllable, some L1 English speakers will identify the first syllable of \emph{balada} as a closed CVC syllable rather than open CV syllable following standard Spanish syllabification. Given that the evidence is only found in the CV syllable type, ambisyllabicity is the likely cause of the reduction in consistent syllabification patterns because words such as \emph{baldosa} would not be a phonological environment for ambisyllabicity in English either. While the effect did not remain significant within either group of speakers, the raw percentages still suggested that CV syllables were less consistent than CVC syllables, but only for the L1 English group. The raw percentage scores actually showed a significant difference for the L1 English group, but the effect did not hold after the logit transformation. This difference was in the expected direction with CV syllables being responded to with much less accuracy than CVC syllables for the L1 English group. Neither the raw percentage scores nor the logit transformed accuracy rates differed between CV and CVC syllable types for the L1 Spanish group. Even though the current study cannot make a definitive claim about the L1 English transference of ambisyllabicity to their L2 Spanish syllable intuitions, there definitely appeared to be something happening to their CV syllabification patterns. 

One limitation in this study is that it only reports on error rates. While reaction times were collected during the course of this experiment, they were not reliable due to experimental design constraints. The design of the experiment displayed the word for 1500 milliseconds before the answer choices were visible to participants and responses were not accepted until the 1500 milliseconds had passed. Most participants began to answer very quickly once they realized that the answer choices, CV or CVC, were not changing. In other words a participant always used the same response button to indicate a CV syllable and the same response button to indicate a CVC syllable throughout the entire experiment. Many participants began anticipating the answer screen to appear so they could respond. This made it impossible to detect stuck keys from a person inadvertently holding the button or excluding responses based on previously reported response time cutoffs, i.e. 100 or 200 milliseconds. A future study could take advantage of reaction as an independent variable of interest by allowing participants to respond as soon as they had made their decision rather than forcing them to wait. It would also be possible to switch answer response buttons, although this may unnecessarily complicate the task and served as the reason for not doing so in the current study. Nonetheless, utilizing reaction time data with syllabification experiments may make predictions possible in tasks for other language processing tasks where segmentation, lexical access or vocabulary size is concerned. Visual and auditory monitoring, word-naming and lexical decision experiments could be much more informative with syllabic intuitions guiding experimental item selection. The last possible limitation was the two-alternative forced choice task of CV and CVC. Future studies may benefit by increasing the number of syllable types. Including other syllable types such as CCV, VC or VCC in the list would increase the complexity of the task, but would resemble more real-life language processing tasks encountered by language learners.

%Participants saw the other pair item in the critical word pairs than they saw in the segmentation experiment, but now I am not sure. However, if this were the case, there is no need to go through this setup if experimental design is not changed because the reaction time data was not useable in the current conditions. Nonetheless, a future combined study must make sure the experiments where reaction time is crucial precedes the experiment where it is non-essential in order to avoid a repetition priming effect \ttodo[inline]{citation}.
