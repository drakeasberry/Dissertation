\section{Introduction}

Write my introduction to the syllabification article here (Will write the introduction LAST)
The section of your article most likely to be read, not skimmed or skipped. The first paragraph or two is the overview of the article: describe the problem, question or theory motivating the research. 

%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 1-1
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Background}

In the second part, describe relevant theories, review past research and give more details on the current research question. Do not forget about signposting, which headings and subheadings can naturally create for the reader.

%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 1-2
%-----------------------------------

\subsection{Present Study}
The third section titled, “The Present Experiment” or “The Present Research”, follows and contains experimental descriptions and how they address the questions being asked.
For most articles, keep your introduction under 10 pages

\section{Methods}

Write this section FIRST
is the section that describes how the research was conducted. A good one shows how well thought out the experiment design is and allows other researchers to easily replicate it. This section also follows a formula:

%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 2-1
%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Participants}

Give accurate descriptions of participant groups, how they were classified, number of participants, etc.

%-----------------------------------
%	SUBSECTION 2-2
%-----------------------------------

\subsection{Design}

Give an accurate idea of how the overall project was designed, what previous studies is it based off, theoretical principles, etc.

DO NOT write about what participants do in this section.

\subsection{Instrumentation}

Any special instrumentation could be included here (I am not sure that mine deserves a devoted section to instrumentation.

\subsection{Procedure}
Participants were seated in front of a laptop computer with a USB button box in order to complete the experiment in PsychoPy. At the beginning of the experiment, participants entered in demographic information as asked in the basic language profile (BLP). Once they had entered the demographic information, the participants completed the Spanish version of LexTALE-ESP---a Spanish vocabulary test. 

Participants were instructed that they would be presented with a sequence of letters of for which they were to find in a list of words that would appear on the screen one by one. They were instructed to respond only if they had identified the sequence of letters in the word on the screen and to do nothing otherwise. The participants were also instructed to respond as fast as possible and were reminded with feedback screens staggered throughout the trials encouraging faster response times. The participants were first presented with 8 practice trials that followed the same criteria and procedure as the 48 experimental trials. Each trial began with text "Encuentre" above the sequence of letters, henceforth the target, which was presented in all capital letters in the center of the screen. The initial trial screen contained the target for 4 seconds before returning to a blank screen for 500 milliseconds. Following the blank screen, a list of ten words was presented randomly one at a time for 2000 milliseconds each with a 150 millisecond interstimulus interval. Only one word, the carrier item, in each list of ten words contained the target while the other nine words were simply filler items. The target was always found at the beginning of the carrier item. None of the filler items shared any of its first three letters with the target. The search target remained in the upper right hand portion of the screen to serve as a reminder while all ten words from the list were presented. Even when a response was made, only the first response was recorded, but the experiment did not progress until the 2000 millisecond presentation time had passed. Once all ten words from the list had been presented, the next trial began with a new target for participants to find in the next set list of ten words. No carrier or filler items were repeated through out the entire experiment. Participants were also given an optional 2 minute break halfway through the experimental trials.

Following the experiment participants also completed the English version of the LexTALE vocabulary test. 

Following the LexTALE task, participants also completed the bilingual language profile (BLP).


\textbf{DELETE ME
The first refer to mainly scope and size of research project while the procedure section is usually much more in-depth. Here, you connect your procedures to those in already published articles when possible and given detailed descriptions of classifications and scales used in procedure. Essentially ensure the reader does not suspect anything is being hidden and the researcher is honest. Do not repeat any unnecessary information in subsequent experiments of the paper.}

\section{Results}

describe the analyses the researcher has done, but do not overload. Instead of creating a laundry list of statistics, create the story you want to tell using only the statistics that are related to addressing your problem. 

For each task, review the hypothesis, give the statistics and say what the result of the test means. 

Do not discuss the findings until you reach the discussion session. 

This is where tables and figures can help keep the paper looking clean and crisp instead of cluttered unorganized statistical test lists that are hard to follow. 

Figures show patterns while tables give details.

\section{Discussion}

split into several small sections following each individual experiment’s results sections where applicable. 
The General Discussion steps back and begins with an overview of the problem and then the findings. A general rule of thumb is to keep this section shorter than the introduction. Only give limitation directly related to the current study, not the general limitation of the research or the field as a whole and be sure to give a good reason for why these limitations are not as bad as they sound on the surface.
